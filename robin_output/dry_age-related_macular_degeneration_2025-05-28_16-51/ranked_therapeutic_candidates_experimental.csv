"Rapamycin (Sirolimus, catalog R0395, Sigma-Aldrich)","Proposal for Rapamycin (Sirolimus, catalog R0395, Sigma-Aldrich)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Rapamycin, also known as sirolimus (catalog R0395, Sigma-Aldrich), is a natural macrolide compound discovered as a product of the bacterium Streptomyces hygroscopicus isolated from soil on Easter Island. It belongs to the class of mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) inhibitors and has a well‐defined chemical structure characterized by a large lactone ring. Over the past decades, rapamycin has been extensively studied for its potent immunosuppressive and anti‐proliferative actions, and it has been repurposed for various clinical indications beyond its original use in transplantation and oncology. In the context of drug development for ocular conditions, its property as a selective inhibitor of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) forms the basis of its potential utility in diseases characterized by impaired autophagy. Rapamycin is currently being explored as a candidate to treat dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) specifically by relieving autophagy suppression in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. The compound’s pharmacokinetic profile, including its known drug–drug interactions and formulation properties, further supports its repurposing for ocular applications (Mei et al., 2022; Chang et al., 2022).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, rapamycin has been used in several therapeutic contexts owing to its immunomodulatory and anti‐proliferative properties. Clinically, it is used as an immunosuppressant in renal transplantation and has anti‐neoplastic activity in certain cancers. Its broad mechanism of action by targeting mTORC1 has led to its investigation in aging and neurodegenerative disorders. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that rapamycin activates autophagy and exerts protective effects in central nervous system models of neurodegeneration, and its effectiveness in reducing age‐related cellular senescence has been validated in various animal studies (Kaarniranta et al., 2013; Kolosova et al., 2012). In the ophthalmologic arena, rapamycin has been evaluated in several retinal degeneration models. Multiple preclinical studies have shown that rapamycin improves cellular clearance mechanisms in RPE cells, reduces oxidative stress, and ameliorates morphological and functional degeneration in animal models of retinal degeneration and dry AMD (Chang et al., 2022; Falcão et al., 2024). In addition, intravitreal and subconjunctival formulations of sirolimus have been assessed in early-phase clinical trials for conditions such as uveitis and geographic atrophy—a late-stage manifestation of dry AMD—demonstrating a favorable ocular safety profile (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2006; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2008). Although clinical efficacy in dry AMD has yet to be definitively established, the compound’s consistent pharmacological behavior across multiple systems and disease models positions it well for further evaluation in this context.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, rapamycin exerts its effects primarily through binding the intracellular protein FKBP12. The resulting FKBP12-rapamycin complex interacts with mTORC1, which is a central regulator of cell growth, protein synthesis, and autophagy. Under nutrient-rich conditions, mTORC1 phosphorylates key proteins (such as ULK1 and TFEB), thereby suppressing autophagy by inhibiting the formation of autophagosomes and blocking lysosomal biogenesis. In the setting of dry AMD, hyperactivation of mTORC1 in the RPE has been linked to impaired autophagy, diminished clearance of damaged organelles, and reduced phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments (POS), ultimately contributing to lipofuscin accumulation and RPE dysfunction (Kaarniranta et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2019).

Rapamycin’s mechanism of inhibiting mTORC1 leads to a restoration of autophagic flux by relieving the phosphorylation-dependent block on autophagy. This results in the increased formation of autophagosomes and facilitates the subsequent fusion with lysosomes—a process termed phagosome–lysosome fusion—that is essential for the degradation and clearance of cellular debris, including the continuously ingested POS by RPE cells (Falcão et al., 2024). Moreover, inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin activates transcription factors such as TFEB, which upregulate the expression of genes required for lysosomal biogenesis and function. In turn, an enhanced lysosomal compartment improves the degradation of photoreceptor outer segments and mitigates the accumulation of toxic aggregates like lipofuscin, a hallmark of dry AMD pathology (Falcão et al., 2024; Chang et al., 2022). In addition, rapamycin’s effects on autophagy and inflammation are interconnected: by promoting autophagy, rapamycin indirectly decreases the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and suppresses the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, thereby further protecting RPE cell function (Wang et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2019).

Expected Effect:
In the proposed therapeutic hypothesis for dry AMD, the primary expected effect of rapamycin administration is to reverse mTORC1 hyperactivity within the RPE. In a well–established in vitro setting of RPE cells, rapamycin is anticipated to restore autophagic flux, manifesting as an increased LC3-II/LC3-I ratio and a reduction in p62 levels, consistent with enhanced autophagosome formation and improved autophagosome–lysosome fusion (Falcão et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2015). This restoration should lead to enhanced clearance of phagocytosed photoreceptor outer segments, thereby decreasing the retention of lipofuscin-like granules in RPE cells and ultimately protecting against the degenerative processes associated with dry AMD. Specifically, improved clearance of outer segment debris is expected to reduce oxidative stress and inflammatory responses within the RPE layer, contributing to cellular survival and maintaining the homeostatic functions of the RPE (Chang et al., 2022; Falcão et al., 2024).

Additionally, because RPE cells are known to express key autophagy and phagocytosis proteins—including LC3, TFEB, and LAMP1—the reactivation of autophagy pathways by rapamycin is expected to directly influence these molecular targets (Falcão et al., 2024; Kaarniranta et al., 2013). The compound’s role in activating TFEB via dephosphorylation plays a critical part in the upregulation of lysosomal gene expression, which is essential for effective phagolysosomal clearance. Furthermore, by mitigating the accumulation of oxidized proteins and other toxic waste products within RPE cells, rapamycin is posited to decelerate the progression of retinal degeneration that typifies dry AMD. This mechanistic framework is supported by preclinical animal studies wherein rapamycin improved retinal morphology and function, notably in models of sodium iodate-induced retinal degeneration and other experimental paradigms (Zhao et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2019).

Overall Evaluation:
When considering rapamycin as a candidate therapeutic for dry age-related macular degeneration, several strengths emerge from the comprehensive review of biochemical, preclinical, and early clinical data. First, the mechanistic rationale for targeting mTORC1 in RPE cells is robust, as mTOR hyperactivation is directly linked to the suppression of autophagy and impaired phagocytosis—a critical component in the pathogenesis of dry AMD (Chang et al., 2022; Kaarniranta et al., 2013). The ability of rapamycin to restore autophagic flux, enhance lysosomal biogenesis, and thereby improve the clearance of photoreceptor outer segments is well documented in multiple independent studies (Falcão et al., 2024).

A further strength of rapamycin is its extensive therapeutic history, which includes successful application as an immunosuppressant and anti-proliferative agent. Its favorable pharmacological profile has facilitated its use in both systemic and localized settings, and early-phase ocular trials have demonstrated that intravitreal or subconjunctival administration of sirolimus is well tolerated in the eye (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2006; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2008). These findings provide an encouraging safety background for its proposed use in dry AMD. Moreover, the fact that rapamycin’s mechanism is highly specific—targeting mTORC1 without broadly suppressing other signaling cascades—offers mechanistic clarity that is appealing in a clinical scenario where off-target effects can be particularly detrimental.

Across numerous preclinical models of retinal degeneration, rapamycin has consistently demonstrated protective effects mediated by the activation of autophagy and suppression of inflammatory pathways. For example, studies have shown that treatment with rapamycin in animal models results in improved retinal pigment epithelium morphology and partial restoration of photoreceptor function, which suggests that the compound can modulate the cellular homeostasis within the retina in a manner that is highly relevant to the pathophysiology of dry AMD (Falcão et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2022). The expected therapeutic effect of enhanced clearance of POS via improved autophagosome–lysosome fusion is particularly compelling, as defective phagocytosis and accumulation of debris are known to be key contributors to AMD pathology (Falcão et al., 2024; Kaarniranta et al., 2013).

Nevertheless, there are significant challenges and potential weaknesses that temper enthusiasm for rapamycin in this indication. One major concern is the translation of promising preclinical results into meaningful clinical outcomes. Although early-phase ocular safety studies indicate that rapamycin is well tolerated, larger randomized controlled trials in patients with geographic atrophy—the advanced form of dry AMD—have yielded mixed results, with some studies reporting a lack of significant efficacy in halting disease progression or even showing adverse changes in retinal structure (Wang et al., 2022; Wong et al., 2013). These clinical observations underscore the complexity of mTOR signaling in the retina, where both underactive and overactive autophagy can be deleterious. The precise dosing, formulation, and delivery strategies necessary to achieve the optimal balance of autophagy activation without triggering harmful metabolic or inflammatory responses remain to be fully elucidated.

Another potential weakness lies in the systemic effects of rapamycin. Although local administration (intravitreal or subconjunctival injections) minimizes systemic exposure, rapamycin’s well-known metabolic and immunomodulatory effects still pose challenges in long-term therapy, especially given that patients with dry AMD are often elderly and may have comorbidities that could be exacerbated by these systemic actions (Kolosova et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2022). Additionally, while the compound’s ability to promote autophagy provides a clear mechanistic basis for its use, the precise impact on RPE-specific functions—particularly on phagocytosis of POS and the subsequent clearance processes—has not been conclusively demonstrated in clinical settings. Preclinical evidence certainly supports improved autophagic flux and lysosomal degradation in RPE cells (Falcão et al., 2024; Chang et al., 2022), but translating these findings to a measurable clinical benefit in patients with dry AMD presents an ongoing challenge.

Furthermore, variability in disease etiology among patients with dry AMD suggests that a “one-size-fits-all” approach may not be applicable. Dry AMD is a multifactorial disease influenced by genetics, oxidative stress, inflammation, and environmental factors, and while targeting mTORC1 is appealing because of its central role in modulating autophagy and cellular metabolism, it is likely that a combination of therapeutic strategies may be required to address the heterogeneous nature of the disease (Yang et al., 2019; Falcão et al., 2024). There is also the consideration that prolonged mTOR inhibition might lead to unintended consequences in cell survival pathways, as mTOR signaling is also involved in various adaptive stress responses. The dual role of autophagy, serving both protective and potentially detrimental functions depending on the context, further complicates the therapeutic landscape (Si et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2022).

In summary, rapamycin presents a promising mechanistic candidate for the treatment of dry AMD based on its ability to inhibit mTORC1, thereby restoring autophagic function and improving the clearance of photoreceptor outer segments in RPE cells. Its established history of use, well-characterized mechanism of action, and demonstrated preclinical efficacy in various retinal degeneration models provide strong support for its continued investigation in this context (Chang et al., 2022; Falcão et al., 2024; Kaarniranta et al., 2013). However, the transition from preclinical promise to clinical efficacy is far from straightforward. Mixed results in clinical studies, potential systemic side effects, and the inherent complexity of modulating autophagic pathways in a multifactorial disease like dry AMD necessitate careful optimization of dosing, delivery mechanisms, and likely combination strategies to achieve a measurable therapeutic benefit. In light of these considerations, while rapamycin is mechanistically attractive and supported by extensive biochemical and preclinical evidence, further clinical studies with refined formulations and clear biomarkers of autophagic modulation in the retina are needed to determine its ultimate utility as a treatment for dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2011; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2012; Wong et al., 2013).

Overall Evaluation:
Strengths of rapamycin for treating dry AMD include its robust mechanistic rationale; as rapamycin directly targets mTORC1, a central regulator of autophagy and RPE phagocytosis, it has the potential to restore impaired cellular clearance mechanisms that contribute to the accumulation of toxic debris in the retina. Its extensive therapeutic history and favorable ocular safety profile in early-phase trials add to its appeal. Moreover, preclinical studies consistently demonstrate improvements in autophagic flux, lysosomal function, and retinal morphology following rapamycin treatment, supporting its potential to decelerate or even reverse pathological changes in dry AMD (Chang et al., 2022; Falcão et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2015).

Conversely, weaknesses include the mixed clinical efficacy observed in geographic atrophy trials and the potential for adverse systemic and ocular effects associated with long-term mTOR inhibition. The heterogeneity of dry AMD and the complex, sometimes paradoxical role of autophagy in retinal physiology further complicate rapamycin’s clinical translation. Additionally, while extensive preclinical data support rapamycin’s ability to enhance autophagy, there remains a gap in direct clinical evidence confirming that this leads to improved RPE phagocytosis or enhanced clearance of photoreceptor outer segments in patients with dry AMD (Wang et al., 2022; Kaarniranta et al., 2013; Si et al., 2023). Thus, the overall evaluation suggests that rapamycin is a scientifically sound candidate with strong preclinical support but that its clinical utility in dry AMD will depend on further studies to optimize delivery, dosing, and patient stratification.

In conclusion, rapamycin holds considerable promise as a repurposed drug candidate for dry AMD by virtue of its well-characterized mTORC1 inhibitory actions that restore autophagic function and facilitate the clearance of toxic photoreceptor debris. However, given the complexities of AMD pathogenesis and the mixed outcomes in early-phase clinical trials, additional research that rigorously evaluates its impact on RPE-specific functions and long-term retinal health is warranted before it can be endorsed as a definitive therapeutic strategy (Falcão et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2022; Wong et al., 2013).

"Simvastatin (Zocor®, catalog S6196, Sigma-Aldrich)","Proposal for Simvastatin (Zocor®, catalog S6196, Sigma-Aldrich)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Simvastatin is a lipophilic synthetic HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor originally derived from fungal metabolites and subsequently chemically modified to increase its lipophilicity and bioavailability, and it belongs to the class of statins that were initially developed to lower cholesterol levels in cardiovascular disease patients (Gehlbach et al., 2016). This compound, marketed as Zocor®, is produced via fermentation processes followed by extensive chemical derivatization to yield a clinically active lactone prodrug that is converted in vivo to its active hydroxyacid form, a transformation that enhances its capacity to inhibit the key enzyme of the mevalonate pathway (Guymer et al., 2013). Statins as a class have been ubiquitously used as lipid‐lowering agents in cardiovascular medicine due to their ability to inhibit hepatic cholesterol synthesis and upregulate LDL receptor expression, thereby reducing plasma levels of low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (Ludwig et al., 2021). The inherent lipophilicity of simvastatin also permits it to cross cell membranes, which appears to be beneficial for targeting tissues such as the retina, where the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is critically involved in cholesterol homeostasis and photoreceptor outer segment clearance (Mast et al., 2018).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, simvastatin has been used extensively in the management of hypercholesterolemia and prevention of cardiovascular events, with a well‐established safety record in millions of patients worldwide (Diamantis et al., 2017). In addition to its primary indication for cholesterol lowering, compelling epidemiological observations and preclinical studies have suggested that statins may offer beneficial pleiotropic effects such as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions, which led to investigations into their potential role in non-cardiovascular diseases (Gehlbach et al., 2016). For instance, simvastatin has been explored in various proof-of-concept clinical trials for dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) – a condition that shares pathological features with atherosclerosis, such as abnormal cholesterol deposition and chronic low-grade inflammation – with studies noting trends toward slowed disease progression among statin-treated patients (Guymer et al., 2013; Vavvas et al., 2016). Although results from clinical trials remain heterogeneous, and large randomized controlled trials remain scarce, early-phase studies have provided mechanistic rationale and preliminary clinical signals supporting the repurposing of simvastatin for dry AMD and similar retinal disorders (Gehlbach et al., 2016; Ludwig et al., 2021).

Mechanism of Action:
Simvastatin exerts its primary pharmacological action by competitively inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, thereby decreasing the synthesis of mevalonate and subsequent cholesterol production in hepatocytes; a similar mechanism is operative in extra-hepatic tissues such as the RPE, where local cholesterol biosynthesis is critical (Qian et al., 2011). By lowering intracellular cholesterol, simvastatin not only reduces the formation of cholesterol-rich deposits but also alters the lipid composition of cellular membranes, resulting in improved membrane fluidity that can modulate receptor function and signal transduction processes (Mast et al., 2018). Mechanistic studies have further indicated that statins modulate the expression of key genes involved in cholesterol trafficking; for example, simvastatin has been found to upregulate Cd36 expression, a scavenger receptor involved in the uptake of oxidized LDL, suggesting a compensatory mechanism that maintains retinal cholesterol balance when local synthesis is inhibited (Mast et al., 2018). In parallel, simvastatin’s pleiotropic anti-inflammatory effects are mediated in part through the inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis, which results in reduced post-translational modification of small GTP-binding proteins such as Rho and Rac, thereby dampening inflammatory signaling pathways including NF-κB and MAPK cascades that contribute to chronic retinal inflammation observed in dry AMD (Diamantis et al., 2017; Vavvas et al., 2016). Additionally, emerging evidence suggests statins may enhance autophagy-mediated phagocytosis in RPE cells, a process crucial for the clearance of photoreceptor outer segment debris, by modulating intracellular cholesterol levels and maintaining optimal membrane properties essential for autophagosome formation and lysosomal fusion (Gehlbach et al., 2016; Guymer et al., 2013). These multifaceted molecular interactions underline simvastatin’s capacity to restore RPE cell homeostasis by regulating cholesterol metabolism, reducing oxidative stress, and mitigating inflammatory cascades – key pathogenic factors in the progression of dry AMD (Mast et al., 2018; Vavvas et al., 2016).

Expected Effect:
In the context of dry AMD, the expected therapeutic effect of simvastatin is multifactorial. Primarily, its ability to inhibit HMG-CoA reductase is anticipated to reduce local cholesterol biosynthesis in the RPE, thereby preventing the accumulation of cholesterol-rich drusen deposits that are characteristic of AMD progression (Gehlbach et al., 2016; Mast et al., 2018). Improved membrane fluidity resulting from lower cholesterol content is expected to enhance the functional capacity of RPE cells, particularly by supporting autophagy-mediated phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments – a critical clearance mechanism that prevents debris accumulation and subsequent retinal degeneration (Guymer et al., 2013; Marchesi et al., 2024). Furthermore, through its anti-inflammatory properties, simvastatin is expected to reduce the chronic, low-grade inflammatory milieu present in the sub-retinal space, thereby potentially slowing the secondary degenerative changes that exacerbate dry AMD (Vavvas et al., 2016; Ludwig et al., 2021). These mechanisms are supported by data indicating that key inflammation-related genes and inflammatory cytokines are modulated in RPE cells upon statin treatment, and that genetic variants associated with cholesterol metabolism and inflammation contribute to AMD risk (Gehlbach et al., 2016; Memarzadeh & Heidari-Soureshjani, 2022). Collectively, the expected effects of simvastatin in relevant cellular assays include restoration of cholesterol homeostasis, enhanced RPE membrane dynamics, dampening of pro-inflammatory signaling, and improved autophagic clearance – establishing a rationale for its repurposing as a therapeutic candidate for dry AMD (Mast et al., 2018; Memarzadeh & Heidari-Soureshjani, 2022).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, the therapeutic candidate simvastatin presents as a promising repurposed agent for dry AMD based on several compelling strengths. Its long-standing clinical use in cardiovascular disease provides an extensive safety profile and abundant clinical experience, which is a significant advantage when contemplating drug repurposing (Diamantis et al., 2017; Ludwig et al., 2021). The mechanistic basis for its use in dry AMD is well-supported by robust biochemical evidence: simvastatin’s capacity to inhibit HMG-CoA reductase leads to decreased local cholesterol biosynthesis, altered membrane fluidity, and modulation of lipid raft composition within RPE cells – all of which are crucial for maintaining effective autophagy-mediated phagocytosis and mitigating the formation of drusen deposits (Mast et al., 2018; Gehlbach et al., 2016). Moreover, its pleiotropic anti-inflammatory effects potentially provide additional benefits by attenuating the chronic inflammatory processes that contribute to retinal degeneration in dry AMD (Vavvas et al., 2016; Guymer et al., 2013). However, despite these strengths, there are notable weaknesses that require careful consideration. The clinical evidence to date regarding statins in AMD is mixed, with some pilot studies and observational data suggesting modest benefits while large-scale randomized trials have yet to definitively demonstrate efficacy in slowing AMD progression (Memarzadeh & Heidari-Soureshjani, 2022; Ludwig et al., 2021). Additionally, compensatory mechanisms, such as increased retinal uptake of serum cholesterol observed in preclinical studies, may mitigate some of the beneficial effects of inhibited local cholesterol synthesis, thereby complicating the overall impact on RPE homeostasis (Mast et al., 2018). Further, while simvastatin’s ocular biodistribution is favorable relative to hydrophilic statins, its ability to consistently achieve therapeutic concentrations in the posterior segment remains an area of active investigation (Ludwig et al., 2021; ClinicalTrials.gov). In summary, while simvastatin possesses significant mechanistic merits – notably through improvements in RPE cholesterol regulation, membrane fluidity, reduction of inflammation, and possible enhancement of autophagic processes – the translational gap between preclinical promise and robust clinical efficacy in dry AMD necessitates further focused trials. The overall evaluation supports advancing simvastatin into additional preclinical studies that are designed to optimize dosing for ocular tissue exposure, in parallel with well-powered, genotype-stratified clinical trials to conclusively define its benefit in dry AMD (Gehlbach et al., 2016; Memarzadeh & Heidari-Soureshjani, 2022).

"Metformin (Glucophage®, catalog D150959, Sigma-Aldrich)","Proposal for Metformin (Glucophage®, catalog D150959, Sigma-Aldrich)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Metformin (Glucophage®, catalog D150959, Sigma-Aldrich) is a synthetic biguanide that was originally derived from the plant Galega officinalis, historically known for its hypoglycemic properties. It belongs to the biguanide class of therapeutic compounds, which have long been used to manage type 2 diabetes mellitus through their capacity to lower blood glucose levels. The discovery of metformin’s beneficial metabolic effects dates back several decades, and it has since become the most widely prescribed oral antihyperglycemic agent. As a repurposing candidate for dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), metformin is of particular interest because its established safety profile, low cost, and demonstrated systemic efficacy make it attractive for chronic conditions beyond diabetes. In addition to its original indication, this compound has begun to attract attention as a modulator of cellular energy homeostasis and autophagic flux—a key consideration in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) dysfunction observed in dry AMD (Amin et al., 2022; Augustin & Atorf, 2023).

Therapeutic History:
Metformin has been in clinical use since the 1950s for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, where its primary action is reducing hepatic gluconeogenesis and improving insulin sensitivity. Over the years, extensive biochemical and clinical data have underscored its safety profile, with gastrointestinal discomfort being the most common side effect and serious adverse effects such as lactic acidosis occurring very rarely in patients with appropriate renal function (Amin et al., 2022; Augustin & Atorf, 2023). Beyond diabetes, epidemiological and preclinical studies have suggested that metformin may impart protection in various age-related and metabolic diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, cardiovascular diseases, and even certain neurodegenerative conditions. In the retinal field, several studies have examined its effects in experimental models of retinal degeneration and diabetic retinopathy, where metformin has been shown to reduce retinal inflammation, oxidative damage, and aberrant angiogenesis. Although direct clinical trial data in dry AMD are still emerging—with one completed phase II clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016) evaluating its effects on geographic atrophy progression in non-diabetic patients—the available preclinical and retrospective epidemiological evidence indicates that metformin may reduce the risk or progression of AMD (Eton et al., 2022; Romdhoniyyah et al., 2021). This history of repurposing for retinal diseases, coupled with its well-documented systemic tolerability, supports ongoing efforts to explore metformin as a therapeutic candidate specifically for dry AMD.

Mechanism of Action:
Metformin exerts its primary pharmacological action through the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a serine/threonine kinase that functions as a cellular energy sensor. When metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex I, there is an increase in the cellular AMP:ATP ratio, leading to robust activation of AMPK. This enzyme, which comprises multiple isoforms—including the critical AMPKα2 subunit expressed in retinal tissues—is responsible for initiating a cascade of downstream effects that restore cellular energy balance. Through AMPK activation, metformin induces a metabolic reprogramming that suppresses anabolic processes (such as fatty acid synthesis and protein translation) while enhancing catabolic pathways, notably increasing glycolysis, stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis, and upregulating oxidative defense mechanisms (Xu et al., 2018).

In the context of the retinal pigment epithelium, AMPK activation by metformin has been shown to promote autophagy—a vital cellular process that degrades and recycles damaged organelles and proteins. This is particularly significant for RPE cells, which are responsible for phagocytosing the daily shed outer segments of photoreceptors. Dysfunction in this autophagic process is a hallmark of dry AMD, as impaired clearance leads to the accumulation of toxic debris and lipofuscin, ultimately contributing to cellular senescence and degeneration (Abokyi, 2021; Amin et al., 2022). Further, metformin’s activation of AMPK in RPE cells upregulates key transcriptional factors and proteins—including PGC-1α, Nrf2, and Sirt1—that enhance mitochondrial function and protect against oxidative stress. This multifaceted mechanism is thought to stabilize the energy homeostasis in RPE cells and promote the maturation of autophagosomes, ultimately accelerating the clearance of photoreceptor debris—a process critical for maintaining retinal integrity in dry AMD (Amin et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2018).

Additionally, preclinical studies in vitro have demonstrated that metformin reduces reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and promotes the expression of antioxidants and tight junction proteins (such as occludin and ZO-1) in RPE cells. The compound’s ability to modulate inflammatory signaling pathways, such as NF-κB inhibition, further contributes to a reduction in the inflammatory milieu that exacerbates retinal degeneration. Collectively, these molecular interactions underscore the therapeutic rationale for using metformin to rectify the metabolic deficits and autophagic dysfunction observed in dry AMD (Amin et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2020).

Expected Effect:
In the proposed assay involving RPE cells and the dry AMD context, metformin is expected to activate AMPK in these cells, thereby enhancing their energy homeostasis and boosting autophagy-dependent phagosome maturation. This pharmacological intervention should lead to more efficient clearance of photoreceptor outer segment debris accumulated in RPE cells, a pathological hallmark of dry AMD. In vitro models using iPSC-derived RPE cells have validated that AMPK activation promotes autophagic flux and improves cellular viability under oxidative stress conditions. Based on these findings, metformin is anticipated to reduce ROS levels, decrease apoptotic cell death, and restore mitochondrial function in stressed RPE cells (Qu et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020).

Furthermore, metformin’s action is expected to be dose-dependent, supporting its repurposing in chronic retinal degenerative conditions. Preclinical animal models have demonstrated preservation of retinal architecture and function with metformin treatment, as evidenced by improved electrophysiological measurements and reduced thinning of the outer nuclear layer following oxidative or light-induced damage (Xu et al., 2018; Amin et al., 2022). Gene expression studies in these models indicate that metformin treatment leads to the upregulation of mitochondrial markers (such as COX-II and Tfam) and antioxidative enzymes, suggesting that its therapeutic benefit in dry AMD is mediated by enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and reduced oxidative stress (Xu et al., 2018; Buonfiglio et al., 2024).

Given that RPE cells express AMPK isoforms essential for autophagic activity, the expected effect of metformin in this context is a significant improvement in RPE cell function, stabilization of the blood-retina barrier, and a slowing in the progression of geographic atrophy. This is consistent with epidemiological data indicating that diabetic patients on metformin have a reduced risk of developing AMD, underscoring the translational relevance of the underlying mechanism (Romdhoniyyah et al., 2021; Augustin & Atorf, 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
Metformin emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate for dry age-related macular degeneration based on a convergence of biochemical, preclinical, and epidemiological evidence. The principal strengths of metformin include its well-established clinical safety profile, low cost, and decades-long history of systemic use that provides extensive real-world data on tolerability (Amin et al., 2022; Augustin & Atorf, 2023). Mechanistically, the drug’s ability to activate AMPK in retinal pigment epithelial cells addresses key pathological processes in dry AMD, such as impaired autophagy, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Preclinical data support that metformin enhances autophagic flux and promotes mitochondrial biogenesis, resulting in improved clearance of photoreceptor debris and preservation of RPE function—a novel approach that contrasts with more generalized metabolic modulators (Xu et al., 2018; Abokyi, 2021).

The expected therapeutic effect in dry AMD includes restoration of cellular energy homeostasis and enhanced clearance mechanisms in RPE cells, which, if translated clinically, could slow disease progression and improve visual outcomes. The epidemiological association between metformin use and reduced AMD risk provides additional, albeit indirect, support for its repurposing in this indication (Romdhoniyyah et al., 2021; Eton et al., 2022).

However, there are several challenges and weaknesses that must be addressed. First, while preclinical and in vitro models provide strong mechanistic rationale, direct clinical evidence specific to dry AMD remains limited. The single completed phase II study (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016) and retrospective data suggest potential benefits, but prospective randomized trials in non-diabetic AMD populations are needed to validate efficacy. Second, although metformin is known to cross certain tissue barriers, detailed pharmacokinetic studies on its ocular penetration and retinal bioavailability are sparse. This raises concerns about whether the dosing achieved systemically in diabetic patients is sufficient to elicit the desired effects in the retina without off-target toxicities. Third, the multifactorial nature of dry AMD—with contributions from genetic, environmental, and metabolic factors—means that a monotherapy approach may not be entirely effective, and metformin might need to be used in combination with other agents that address complement activation, extracellular matrix changes, or proinflammatory cascades.

Another potential concern is that not all studies have reported uniformly protective effects of metformin in retinal models; for example, some comparative studies of AMPK activators suggest that metformin’s variable impact on mitochondrial function could lead to less predictable results under acute oxidative stress conditions (Chan et al., 2020). This underlines the need for precise dosing regimens and patient selection strategies when considering its clinical application in a heterogeneous condition such as dry AMD.

Overall, the strengths of metformin—as a repurposed agent with a strong safety profile, clear mechanistic rationale via AMPK activation, and supportive preclinical evidence—make it a compelling candidate for further exploration in dry AMD. The weaknesses primarily surround the gaps in direct clinical evidence and uncertainties about ocular pharmacokinetics, which will need to be addressed in future studies. In summary, metformin’s ability to correct metabolic deficits and promote autophagic clearance in RPE cells is biologically plausible and supported by preclinical models and epidemiological data, warranting further translational research and ideally controlled clinical trials to establish its role in the treatment of dry AMD (Amin et al., 2022; Augustin & Atorf, 2023; Buonfiglio et al., 2024).

"N-Acetylcysteine (NAC, catalog A7250, Sigma-Aldrich)","Proposal for N-Acetylcysteine (NAC, catalog A7250, Sigma-Aldrich)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) is a well-known thiol compound derived from the naturally occurring amino acid L-cysteine. It is synthesized by acetylating the amino group of cysteine, which not only improves its chemical stability but also enhances its solubility and bioavailability relative to cysteine itself (Atkuri, Mantovani, Herzenberg, & Herzenberg, 2007). Belonging to the class of mucolytic and antioxidant agents, NAC has found widespread use as a precursor for the synthesis of glutathione (GSH)—the primary intracellular antioxidant responsible for neutralizing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. Historically, this compound was serendipitously discovered when its mucolytic properties were exploited in respiratory conditions; however, its ability to serve as a cysteine prodrug has given it a much broader therapeutic appeal in diverse oxidative stress–related conditions (Atkuri et al., 2007; Dodd, Dean, Copolov, Malhi, & Berk, 2008). In the broader context of drug development, thiol compounds like NAC have been extensively investigated due to their capacity to replenish intracellular GSH levels by supplying cysteine—the rate-limiting substrate in glutathione biosynthesis—which has led to therapeutic applications in acetaminophen overdose, pulmonary diseases, and even in certain neuropsychiatric conditions (Dodd et al., 2008).

Therapeutic History:
NAC has enjoyed a long and successful history in both clinical and preclinical settings. It was approved by the FDA for the treatment of acetaminophen (paracetamol) overdose due to its efficacy in replenishing hepatic GSH stores and mitigating hepatotoxicity, which established its safety profile and tolerability in acute and chronic dosing scenarios (Atkuri et al., 2007; Dodd et al., 2008). Beyond its hepatoprotective role, NAC has also been employed as a mucolytic treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and its antioxidant activity has led to investigations in conditions such as cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, and various inflammatory disorders (Dodd et al., 2008). More recently, research has started to explore the potential of NAC in ocular applications, particularly in the context of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Preclinical studies have assessed NAC’s efficacy in protecting retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells from oxidative stress—a key pathological feature of dry AMD—by examining its ability to neutralize ROS, reduce oxidative damage, and replenish intracellular GSH (Hutnik, Kagan, & Liu, 2012; Radomska, 2012). Although direct clinical trials specifically targeting dry AMD with NAC remain limited, several clinical trial protocols (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2023) have incorporated NAC as a therapeutic adjunct, underscoring the growing translational interest in repurposing this well-characterized drug for retinal disorders. This extensive therapeutic history not only demonstrates NAC’s multifaceted utility in systemic diseases but also highlights its potential versatility for chronic ocular conditions where oxidative stress is a critical element in disease progression.

Mechanism of Action:
The primary mechanism of NAC is predicated on its role as a cysteine prodrug, which facilitates the intracellular synthesis of glutathione—a tripeptide composed of glutamate, cysteine, and glycine that plays a pivotal role in neutralizing ROS and maintaining redox balance (Atkuri et al., 2007; Dodd et al., 2008). At the molecular level, once administered, NAC is absorbed through biological membranes, including the blood–retinal barrier (BRB), due to its small molecular weight and favorable physicochemical properties (Hutnik et al., 2012; Dodd et al., 2008). Intracellularly, NAC is deacetylated to L-cysteine, which serves as the limiting substrate in the glutathione biosynthesis pathway. This enhanced availability of cysteine leads to an increase in the synthesis of GSH, thereby replenishing depleted intracellular stores and enabling the cellular antioxidant system to quench harmful ROS such as superoxide radicals, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radicals (Atkuri et al., 2007; Radomska, 2012).

In addition to its indirect antioxidant effect through GSH replenishment, NAC is also capable of directly scavenging free radicals via its sulfhydryl (–SH) group, although this direct effect is modest compared to its role in enhancing glutathione synthesis (Dodd et al., 2008; Atkuri et al., 2007). The compound’s ability to modulate redox-sensitive signaling pathways, including the inhibition of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway and other pro-inflammatory mediators, further contributes to its overall cytoprotective effect in various cell types, including RPE cells (Radomska, 2012). Recent studies in retinal models have shown that NAC pretreatment in RPE cells subjected to oxidative stress not only maintains glutathione levels but also improves mitochondrial function, thereby reducing apoptosis and preserving cell viability (Terluk et al., 2019; Hutnik et al., 2012). Furthermore, NAC has been implicated in the restoration of critical cellular clearance mechanisms, such as the phagosome–lysosome fusion process necessary for the degradation of photoreceptor outer segments—an essential function of RPE cells that becomes impaired in dry AMD (Hutnik et al., 2012; Radomska, 2012). This dual action—both in replenishing the cellular antioxidant capacity and in mitigating oxidative damage through improved mitochondrial and lysosomal function—forms the crux of the proposed therapeutic mechanism by which NAC may exert beneficial effects in the context of dry AMD.

Expected Effect:
The proposed therapeutic effect of NAC in dry AMD centers on its ability to restore redox homeostasis within RPE cells by both replenishing intracellular glutathione and directly neutralizing ROS. In the context of dry AMD, oxidative stress plays a critical role in driving RPE dysfunction, leading to the accumulation of toxic byproducts such as lipofuscin—a pigment composed of oxidized lipids and proteins that impairs normal cellular function—and deficits in the phagosome–lysosome fusion process, which is vital for the clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (Hutnik et al., 2012; Terluk et al., 2019). By supplying cysteine for glutathione biosynthesis, NAC is expected to increase intracellular GSH levels, thereby improving the antioxidant capacity of RPE cells and reducing the burden of ROS (Atkuri et al., 2007; Dodd et al., 2008). Improved glutathione availability can also bolster mitochondrial function and enhance the overall cellular energy status, which is crucial in tissues with high metabolic demand such as the retina (Terluk et al., 2019; Hutnik et al., 2012).

Moreover, the antioxidant effects of NAC are anticipated to prevent the formation or accumulation of lipofuscin within RPE cells by curbing the oxidative modifications of cellular proteins and lipids that contribute to lipofuscinogenesis (Radomska, 2012; Hutnik et al., 2012). Additionally, by mitigating the oxidative stress that disrupts normal degradative pathways, NAC is hypothesized to help restore the efficiency of the phagosome–lysosome fusion process, thereby enhancing the clearance of photoreceptor outer segments and maintaining retinal homeostasis (Hutnik et al., 2012; Terluk et al., 2019). These expected cellular outcomes are particularly significant given that RPE cell dysfunction is a central event in the pathogenesis of dry AMD. The expected preservation of RPE cell viability and function following NAC treatment would likely translate into slowed progression of the disease, improved structural integrity of the retina, and possible stabilization or improvement of visual function, as has been suggested by preclinical data and early-phase clinical investigations (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
Evaluating NAC as a potential repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry AMD reveals several compelling strengths alongside certain limitations that merit further investigation. One of NAC’s primary strengths is its well-established safety profile and widespread clinical use in a variety of oxidative stress–related conditions, ranging from acetaminophen toxicity to chronic pulmonary diseases. This long-standing clinical history supports its potential for chronic administration in a condition like dry AMD that requires long-term treatment (Atkuri et al., 2007; Dodd et al., 2008). Moreover, NAC’s low molecular weight and favorable pharmacokinetic properties—including oral availability and the capacity to penetrate biological barriers such as the BRB—are key attributes that underlie its feasible delivery to retinal tissues (Hutnik et al., 2012; Dodd et al., 2008).

From a mechanistic standpoint, the dual action of NAC—both as an indirect antioxidant via glutathione replenishment and as a direct ROS scavenger—addresses the multifactorial pathogenesis of dry AMD by reducing oxidative stress, maintaining mitochondrial function, and potentially restoring autophagic clearance processes in RPE cells (Radomska, 2012; Terluk et al., 2019). This is particularly valuable given that oxidative damage, lipofuscin accumulation, and impaired phagosome–lysosome fusion are established contributors to RPE degeneration and the progression of dry AMD (Hutnik et al., 2012; Terluk et al., 2019).

However, NAC’s relatively modest direct free radical scavenging capacity and issues with cell permeability have been noted in some studies, and these limitations have prompted research into derivative compounds like N-acetylcysteine ethyl ester (NACET) that demonstrate improved lipophilicity and cellular uptake (Realini, 2022; Tosi et al., 2021). While NAC itself remains a promising candidate due to its extensive clinical record and known mechanism of action, the possibility that its efficacy in RPE cells could be enhanced through formulation modifications or by developing lipophilic prodrugs should be considered as part of a broader drug development strategy (Tosi et al., 2021; Realini, 2022).

Overall, the evidence from biochemical and preclinical literature provides a strong mechanistic rationale for repurposing NAC in dry AMD. Its established safety, oral bioavailability, and capacity to replenish intracellular glutathione make it a strong candidate for therapeutic intervention targeting oxidative stress and RPE dysfunction. Nevertheless, further studies are warranted to optimize drug delivery to the retina, confirm its efficacy in preventing key pathological features such as lipofuscin accumulation and phagosome–lysosome fusion deficits, and to establish its clinical efficacy in slowing or reversing the progression of dry AMD (Hutnik et al., 2012; Terluk et al., 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2023). In summary, while there are limitations that require further study—particularly regarding cell permeability and the comparative efficacy of NAC relative to its more lipophilic derivatives—the overall profile of NAC as an antioxidant, glutathione-replenishing agent with proven safety in multiple indications supports its continued evaluation and development as a repurposed candidate for the treatment of dry age-related macular degeneration.

"Dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera®, catalog 46795, Sigma-Aldrich)","Proposal for Dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera®, catalog 46795, Sigma-Aldrich)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Dimethyl fumarate (DMF, marketed as Tecfidera®) is a methyl ester derivative of fumaric acid that was originally discovered as a naturally occurring substance present in fumaric acid–rich plants such as Fumaria officinalis. It belongs to the class of fumaric acid esters, whose mode of action has been exploited primarily in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. DMF is synthesized through chemical esterification of fumaric acid and has been formulated as an oral drug with a well‐characterized pharmacokinetic profile. As a member of this class, it has been extensively used in the treatment of relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis and psoriasis, where its immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties are key to its therapeutic benefit (Buonfiglio et al., 2024; Manai et al., 2022). The fact that DMF is a small, lipophilic molecule also enables it to cross the blood–retinal barrier (BRB), suggesting its potential utility in ocular applications, an important consideration when evaluating repurposing candidates for retinal diseases such as dry age-related macular degeneration (dry AMD).

Therapeutic History:
DMF has a long-standing history of clinical use in non‐ocular indications. Its approval for relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis and psoriasis is underpinned by comprehensive clinical data demonstrating its immunomodulatory and neuroprotective effects along with a favorable safety profile (Manai et al., 2022). In multiple sclerosis, DMF reduces inflammatory relapses and modifies disease progression in part by shifting immune responses towards a less inflammatory phenotype. Similarly, in psoriasis, DMF modulates cytokine profiles and reduces keratinocyte hyperproliferation, underscoring its anti-inflammatory capabilities. Despite these successes in non-ocular conditions, direct clinical use of DMF in dry AMD or similar retinal degenerative diseases has not been fully established. However, preclinical studies in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells and animal models of ocular diseases have suggested that DMF may confer protective benefits in the retina, due to its ability to activate Nrf2—an essential transcription factor in cellular antioxidant defense—and suppress NF-κB–mediated proinflammatory signaling (Catanzaro et al., 2020; Giunta et al., 2023). Moreover, a clinical trial is currently registered to evaluate the effects of oral DMF on geographic atrophy, a late‐stage manifestation of dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2022). These observations, combined with the extensive clinical safety data available for DMF, support a rationale for its rapid repurposing into the ocular domain.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, DMF exerts its effects primarily by activating the nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway. Under basal conditions, Nrf2 is sequestered in the cytoplasm by its repressor, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1). DMF interacts with Keap1 cysteine residues through Michael addition reactions, thereby modifying Keap1 and inhibiting its ability to promote Nrf2 degradation. This leads to the stabilization and nuclear translocation of Nrf2, where it binds to antioxidant response elements (AREs) in the promoters of target genes (Manai et al., 2022). As a consequence, a cascade of cytoprotective genes is induced, including those encoding phase II detoxifying enzymes such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and enzymes critical for glutathione synthesis (such as glutamate–cysteine ligase). These enzymes collectively enhance cellular antioxidant capacity and improve resistance to oxidative stress (Chen et al., 2012).

In addition to its primary antioxidant function, DMF exerts anti-inflammatory effects by modulating the NF-κB signaling pathway. DMF inhibits the nuclear translocation of NF-κB’s p65 subunit, thereby reducing the transcription of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and other mediators that contribute to the inflammatory milieu observed in dry AMD (Manai et al., 2022; Shimizu et al., 2022). Moreover, DMF indirectly modulates immune responses by affecting cellular metabolism; it succinates key glycolytic enzymes like glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), thereby downregulating aerobic glycolysis, which is often upregulated in inflammatory states (Manai et al., 2022). In experimental models, DMF has been demonstrated to promote neuroprotection via these mechanisms, reducing oxidative damage, dampening inflammatory cytokine secretion, and even modulating autophagic flux (Manai et al., 2022; Shimizu et al., 2022). Although the precise link between Nrf2 activation by DMF and the restoration of lysosomal function in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells remains to be fully elucidated, there is indirect evidence suggesting that improved autophagy via Nrf2 activation can enhance lysosomal clearance and phagocytic clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (Catanzaro et al., 2020; Manai et al., 2022). This biochemical cascade is particularly relevant to AMD pathogenesis, where oxidative stress and impaired proteostasis play central roles.

Expected Effect in RPE and Dry AMD:
In the context of dry AMD, the retinal pigment epithelium is exposed to persistent oxidative stress, which compromises its ability to support photoreceptor function through impaired lysosomal degradation and inefficient phagocytic clearance of photoreceptor outer segments. The expected pharmacological effect of DMF in this cellular environment is multifaceted. First, by activating the Nrf2 pathway, DMF is expected to upregulate a suite of antioxidant enzymes (including HO-1 and NQO1) that can neutralize reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby reducing oxidative damage within RPE cells (Buonfiglio et al., 2024; Catanzaro et al., 2020). Second, through its inhibition of NF-κB, DMF should decrease the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that contribute to chronic inflammation in the RPE layer, a key pathogenic feature of dry AMD (Manai et al., 2022; Marchesi et al., 2024). Furthermore, preclinical studies in RPE cell models have shown that DMF can improve mitochondrial function and reduce apoptosis under conditions of oxidative stress, as demonstrated in cell culture models exposed to blue light—a known inducer of oxidative damage mimicking the environmental insults experienced in AMD (Shimizu et al., 2022). With respect to lysosomal function and phagocytic clearance, the hypothesis is that DMF-mediated activation of Nrf2 may restore autophagic and lysosomal pathways that are critical for the digestion and recycling of photoreceptor outer segments. Although direct evidence in RPE cells specifically showing enhanced lysosomal clearance by DMF is limited, the link between robust Nrf2 signaling, improved autophagy, and proteostasis has been established in various cell types (Manai et al., 2022; Catanzaro et al., 2020). The overall expected downstream outcome is improved RPE homeostasis, which in turn should preserve photoreceptor viability and slow the progression of geographic atrophy, the advanced stage of dry AMD.

Overall Evaluation:
The repurposing of dimethyl fumarate as a therapeutic candidate for dry AMD is an intriguing prospect that is grounded in strong mechanistic rationale. Among the key strengths is its well-documented capacity to activate the Nrf2 transcription factor, thereby upregulating a wide range of antioxidant and cytoprotective genes crucial for mitigating oxidative stress—a critical contributor to RPE degeneration in dry AMD (Buonfiglio et al., 2024; Manai et al., 2022). Alongside its antioxidant effects, DMF also exhibits potent anti-inflammatory properties through the inhibition of NF-κB signaling, which could provide dual protection by reducing the chronic inflammatory environment seen in AMD (Manai et al., 2022; Marchesi et al., 2024).

Another clear strength of DMF is its extensive clinical safety record in multiple sclerosis and psoriasis. This existing clinical data supports the feasibility of repurposing DMF for ocular indications, as it offers established dosage guidelines and safety profiles, potentially accelerating the translation of preclinical findings into clinical trials for dry AMD (Manai et al., 2022; Giunta et al., 2023). In addition, DMF’s small molecular size and lipophilicity are beneficial for crossing the blood–retinal barrier and directly targeting retinal cells, a property that further underpins its potential use in treating retinal diseases (Manai et al., 2022; Buonfiglio et al., 2024).

However, several weaknesses or uncertainties remain. One major challenge is that although there is strong preclinical evidence associating DMF with Nrf2 activation and reduction of oxidative stress in retinal cells, the direct effects of DMF on lysosomal function and enhancement of phagocytic clearance in RPE cells have not been unequivocally demonstrated in published studies (Catanzaro et al., 2020; Manai et al., 2022). While the mechanistic hypothesis is well founded, the absence of direct data means that further focused studies—including detailed analyses of autophagy markers and phagocytic efficiency in RPE cells treated with DMF—are needed to fully validate this aspect of the therapeutic candidate’s potential (Marchesi et al., 2024).

Additionally, while repurposing benefits from an established clinical profile in other diseases, the ocular microenvironment presents unique challenges. For example, the immune-privileged status of the eye and the specific metabolic demands of RPE cells may influence DMF’s pharmacodynamics in ways that are not yet fully understood. There is also the concern that transient depletion of glutathione caused by DMF, as noted in some studies, might temporarily render RPE cells more vulnerable to oxidative insults if dosing and administration are not optimally managed (Chen et al., 2012). Moreover, while clinical trials in geographic atrophy are underway (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2022), the direct translation of the multi-faceted effects observed in non-ocular models to the complex pathophysiology of dry AMD remains to be demonstrated clinically.

In summary, dimethyl fumarate presents a promising candidate for dry AMD therapy due to its dual capacity to activate Nrf2-mediated antioxidant defenses and suppress NF-κB–driven inflammatory responses. Its use is further supported by an extensive clinical history in other indications, promising a potential for rapid repurposing. However, before the candidate can be definitively advanced, further preclinical studies are warranted to specifically address its impact on lysosomal function and phagocytic clearance in retinal pigment epithelial cells. These additional studies should include detailed mechanistic evaluations in AMD-relevant models and careful titration of dosing to balance the initial depletion of endogenous antioxidants with the subsequent upregulation of protective pathways. Overall, while there are clear strengths that lend strong theoretical support to DMF’s use in dry AMD, the gaps in direct mechanistic evidence in the ocular context warrant additional investigation to fully substantiate its therapeutic potential (Shimizu et al., 2022; Manai et al., 2022; Marchesi et al., 2024; Giunta et al., 2023).

"Fenofibrate (Tricor®, catalog F6020, Sigma-Aldrich)","Proposal for Fenofibrate (Tricor®, catalog F6020, Sigma-Aldrich)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Fenofibrate (marketed as Tricor® and available as catalog F6020 from Sigma-Aldrich) is a synthetic fibric acid derivative that belongs to the fibrate class of lipid-lowering agents, originally developed in the 1970s to treat dyslipidemia by reducing triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol while increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (Omae et al., 2012). This compound was discovered through efforts to manipulate lipid metabolism, and its chemical synthesis involves modification of the fibric acid scaffold to produce a drug capable of activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) (Omae et al., 2012). Fenofibrate belongs to a well-established therapeutic class whose members are known to modulate lipid metabolism, inflammation, and vascular function through nuclear receptor–mediated transcriptional regulation, and this class has widespread use for treating dyslipidemia and reducing cardiovascular risk (Abcouwer, 2012). Its mechanism of action, based on PPARα activation, has drawn attention for its potential impact on retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) dysfunction by enhancing lipid handling, promoting energy metabolism, and modulating inflammatory cascades relevant to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (Malek et al., 2010).

Therapeutic History:
Fenofibrate has an extensive clinical history spanning several decades of use in patients with abnormal lipid profiles, with a robust safety record established in hundreds of clinical studies addressing dyslipidemia and cardiovascular risk reduction (Omae et al., 2012). In addition to its approved indication for dyslipidemia, fenofibrate has been investigated in multiple clinical trials for its retinal protective effects in diabetic retinopathy, including well-known studies such as FIELD and ACCORD-eye, where it demonstrated the ability to reduce the progression of diabetic retinal disease (Kataoka et al., 2023; Tomita et al., 2020). Although fenofibrate has not been directly approved or widely used for the treatment of dry AMD, several clinical trials and preclinical studies have evaluated its effects on retinal diseases—for example, fenofibrate has been a component of studies monitoring retinal inflammation and vascular permeability, with several trials (e.g., NCT00683176, NCT03345901, NCT03439345) primarily focused on diabetic retinopathy and macular edema (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2008, 2018). Preclinical studies have further explored its potential in models of neovascular AMD, particularly through its effects on pathological angiogenesis and inflammation in the retina, although the direct evidence for its use in dry AMD remains limited (Lee et al., 2023). As such, prior evidence supports fenofibrate’s ability to protect retinal tissues in conditions where dysregulated lipid metabolism and oxidative stress are contributory factors, forming a biochemical rationale for its repurposing in dry AMD (Qiu et al., 2017).

Mechanism of Action:
Fenofibrate exerts its therapeutic effect primarily by activating the nuclear receptor PPARα, which upon ligand binding dimerizes with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) and binds to specific PPAR response elements (PPREs) in target genes to regulate their transcription (Malek et al., 2010). This activation leads to upregulation of genes involved in fatty acid β-oxidation, lipid efflux, and overall energy metabolism, thereby reducing intracellular lipid accumulation and the associated oxidative stress that is a hallmark of RPE dysfunction in dry AMD (Wang et al., 2023). Besides enhancing lipid metabolism, fenofibrate has been shown to stimulate autophagy, the cellular process that degrades and recycles damaged proteins and organelles, which is critical for maintaining RPE homeostasis and efficient photoreceptor outer segment clearance (Wang et al., 2023). Furthermore, preclinical data indicate that fenofibrate can improve phagosome–lysosome fusion—a key step in RPE-mediated clearance of aged photoreceptor outer segments—through its PPARα-mediated effects on gene expression and possibly via modulation of downstream signaling pathways such as PI3K/AKT (Wang et al., 2023; Tomita et al., 2020). Additionally, fenofibrate’s anti-inflammatory properties include inhibition of NF-κB activation and reduction in the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, thus reducing retinal inflammation and contributing to improved RPE function (Qiu et al., 2017; Abcouwer, 2012). Collectively, these molecular interactions suggest that fenofibrate is capable of improving RPE lipid handling and autophagy while attenuating lipotoxicity—a critical process in the pathogenesis of dry AMD (Lee et al., 2025).

Expected Effect:
In the context of dry AMD, the hypothesis posits that fenofibrate will enhance the RPE’s ability to clear photoreceptor outer segments by improving lipid handling and stimulating autophagy. This is expected to occur through the upregulation of genes responsible for fatty acid oxidation and lipid efflux, thereby reducing lipid overload and accumulation of toxic lipid deposits that impair RPE function (Malek et al., 2010; Qiu et al., 2017). In experimental assays, fenofibrate is anticipated to increase the efficiency of phagosome–lysosome fusion in RPE cells, which is essential for proper degradation of photoreceptor debris; this effect is mediated by PPARα activation and potentially supported by the modulation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathways that are known to be active in RPE cells (Wang et al., 2023; Tomita et al., 2020). The compound’s established anti-inflammatory activity may further reduce oxidative stress and chronic inflammatory responses in the retina, thereby preserving RPE integrity and function over time (Qiu et al., 2017; Omae et al., 2012). Given that RPE cells express high levels of PPARα and that dysregulation of lipid metabolism is implicated in AMD pathophysiology, the expected outcome is an overall improvement in RPE homeostasis with subsequent retardation of dry AMD progression (Kataoka et al., 2023). This mechanistic specificity distinguishes fenofibrate from nonspecific anti-inflammatory agents and underscores its potential as a targeted therapeutic strategy to restore the balance of lipid turnover and autophagy in the RPE (Lee et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
Fenofibrate has several compelling strengths as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry AMD. One of its major strengths lies in its long-standing clinical use and favorable safety profile as a lipid-lowering agent in dyslipidemia, which provides a robust platform for repurposing without the need for extensive preliminary safety studies (Omae et al., 2012; Kataoka et al., 2023). Its well-documented ability to activate PPARα and subsequently modulate key metabolic pathways—including fatty acid oxidation, lipid efflux, and autophagy—positions it as an attractive candidate for restoring defective RPE homeostasis that is central to dry AMD pathogenesis (Malek et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2023). Moreover, preclinical studies have demonstrated that fenofibrate can protect retinal cells by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, which are also implicated in the progression of dry AMD (Qiu et al., 2017; Tomita et al., 2020). Its oral availability and established pharmacokinetics further enhance its appeal in terms of patient compliance and ease of administration (Tomita et al., 2020).

However, there are notable weaknesses and gaps that warrant cautious consideration. To date, the majority of clinical and preclinical studies involving fenofibrate have focused on diabetic retinopathy and neovascular conditions rather than dry AMD specifically, meaning direct evidence supporting its efficacy in dry AMD remains limited (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2008, 2018). Additionally, while the mechanistic rationale linking PPARα activation to improved RPE lipid handling and autophagy is strong, the direct effects of fenofibrate on RPE phagosome–lysosome fusion and clearance of photoreceptor outer segments have yet to be conclusively demonstrated in dry AMD models (Wang et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2025). This gap underscores the need for further targeted studies—both in vitro using primary RPE cells and in vivo in animal models that recapitulate the pathophysiology of dry AMD—to fully validate the proposed mechanism. In addition, potential off-target effects, such as fenofibrate’s known renal excretion issues and other systemic adverse effects when used in high doses, might present challenges in a patient population that could be more vulnerable due to age and comorbidities (Omae et al., 2012; Tomita et al., 2020).

In summary, fenofibrate represents a promising repurposed drug candidate for dry age-related macular degeneration based on its established role as a PPARα agonist, its extensive safety and clinical history in dyslipidemia and diabetic retinopathy, and the compelling mechanistic rationale linking PPARα activation to improved lipid handling, enhanced autophagy, and reduced retinal inflammation. These factors collectively support the hypothesis that fenofibrate can restore RPE function by increasing fatty acid oxidation, promoting phagosome–lysosome fusion, and reducing lipotoxicity, ultimately enhancing the clearance of photoreceptor outer segments. Nonetheless, the absence of direct clinical data in dry AMD mandates additional preclinical studies to solidify this therapeutic concept before advancing to clinical trials in the dry AMD population (Lee et al., 2023; Kataoka et al., 2023). Overall, while fenofibrate’s repurposing for dry AMD is mechanistically sound and supported by indirect evidence, further research is essential to validate its efficacy and safety within this specific retinal pathology.

"Nicotinamide riboside (catalog N2004, Sigma-Aldrich)","Proposal for Nicotinamide riboside (catalog N2004, Sigma-Aldrich)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Nicotinamide riboside (NR) is a naturally occurring pyridine-nucleoside and a member of the vitamin B3 family. It is chemically distinguished as a precursor to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD⁺), a vital coenzyme found in every cell that plays a central role in redox reactions, energy metabolism, and signaling pathways related to cellular stress and survival. NR was initially discovered as a component of milk and other food sources and has since been isolated, purified, and synthesized for research and nutraceutical purposes. The molecule is synthesized through chemical and biotechnological methods and is available commercially (catalog N2004, Sigma-Aldrich). It belongs to the class of NAD⁺ precursors, a group of compounds that have been historically used to boost intracellular NAD⁺ levels and thus enhance metabolic function. In the past, other members of this group, such as nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and nicotinamide itself, have been studied for their beneficial metabolic effects in aging and neurodegenerative disorders. As a nicotinamide riboside, this compound is of particular interest due to its oral bioavailability, favorable pharmacokinetics, and excellent safety profile in human supplementation (Jadeja et al., 2020; Lin & Apte, 2018).

Therapeutic History:
Nicotinamide riboside and related NAD⁺ precursors have been extensively investigated in both preclinical and early clinical studies targeting metabolic dysfunction, neurodegeneration, and age-related diseases. Although the majority of the research has focused on its role in systemic aging and neuroprotection in diseases such as glaucoma and mitochondrial myopathies, several preclinical studies demonstrate its potential application in ocular conditions. For example, clinical trial searches using terms such as “nicotinamide riboside AND (macular degeneration OR AMD OR retina OR RPE OR retinal degeneration)” have identified trials that investigate NAD⁺ precursors in retinal health contexts – even though direct evidence for dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is still emerging (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Furthermore, animal model studies report that NR supplementation can elevate NAD⁺ levels in the retina, leading to enhanced mitochondrial function and increased sirtuin activity, which are crucial for maintaining retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cell health (Jadeja et al., 2020; Lin & Apte, 2018). Additionally, related clinical trials, such as NCT06587945 and NCT06991712, have evaluated the tolerability and potential efficacy of NAD⁺ precursors in retinal diseases like macula-off retinal detachment and primary open-angle glaucoma. Though these trials do not directly target dry AMD, they provide supportive background evidence regarding the safety and biological effects of these agents in ocular tissues (Center for Eye Research Australia, 2024; Leung, 2025). Thus, while NR has a robust therapeutic history as an NAD⁺ booster in various models of aging and neurodegeneration, its repurposing for dry AMD is a logical extension based on its underlying biochemical roles in cellular metabolism and mitochondrial health.

Mechanism of Action:
The therapeutic rationale for employing nicotinamide riboside in dry AMD is anchored in its well-documented mechanism of action at the molecular level. NR serves as a biosynthetic precursor that is phosphorylated by nicotinamide riboside kinases (NRK1 and NRK2) to form nicotinamide mononucleotide, which is subsequently adenylated to NAD⁺ by NMNAT enzymes. Elevated NAD⁺ levels are crucial; NAD⁺ acts not only as a redox cofactor but also as a substrate for sirtuins—NAD⁺-dependent deacetylases that regulate numerous cellular processes, including autophagy, mitochondrial biogenesis, and stress resistance (Lin & Apte, 2018; Jadeja et al., 2020).

Sirtuins, particularly SIRT1 and SIRT3, are of paramount importance in retinal cells. SIRT1 activation promotes deacetylation of transcription factors, including PGC-1α, which in turn drives mitochondrial biogenesis and improves oxidative phosphorylation. By activating sirtuin-dependent pathways, NR thereby enhances autophagy—a catabolic process responsible for the clearance of damaged proteins and organelles. This process extends to sirtuin-dependent autophagy pathways in the retinal pigment epithelium, where autophagy is essential for the proper degradation of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) that RPE cells phagocytose on a regular basis (Lin & Apte, 2018; Jadeja et al., 2020).

Moreover, the activation of sirtuins by increased NAD⁺ may lead to enhanced mitophagy—the selective autophagy of damaged mitochondria—which is critically important for the maintenance of mitochondrial quality control in cells with high metabolic demand such as photoreceptors and RPE cells (Lin & Apte, 2018). Preclinical data also hint at improvements in the clearance of damaged cellular components and a reduction in oxidative stress markers, suggesting that NR may indirectly promote healthier RPE function by maintaining mitochondrial integrity (Jadeja et al., 2020; Ren et al., 2022).

At the molecular level, NAD⁺ and sirtuins regulate key signaling pathways such as the AMPK/mTOR axis. AMPK activation, a hallmark of energy stress, is associated with induction of autophagy, whereas mTOR inhibition similarly promotes autophagic processes. As such, by elevating NAD⁺ levels, NR can shift cellular metabolism toward increased mitochondrial turnover and improved bioenergetics, both of which are compromised in the RPE of patients with dry AMD. In addition, maintaining NAD⁺ levels prevents the activation of deleterious NAD⁺-consuming enzymes like PARP-1 which, when overactivated, lead to decreased NAD⁺ and energy failure (Lin & Apte, 2018; Jadeja et al., 2020). The overall cascade—from NR supplementation to NAD⁺ elevation, sirtuin activation, enhanced autophagy, and improved mitochondrial function—thereby establishes a clear molecular rationale for its potential use in drug repurposing for dry AMD.

Expected Effect:
Based on its mechanism of action, nicotinamide riboside is expected to exert several beneficial effects in the context of dry AMD, particularly in RPE cells. First, NR is anticipated to elevate intracellular NAD⁺ levels in RPE cells, thereby activating sirtuin enzymes such as SIRT1. Activation of SIRT1 is linked to improved mitochondrial health through the induction of mitochondrial biogenesis and the promotion of autophagy, a process critical for the removal of damaged cellular components. In the RPE, effective autophagy is essential not only for maintaining cellular homeostasis but also for the phagocytic clearance of photoreceptor outer segments—a process that deteriorates with age and contributes to the pathogenesis of dry AMD (Lin & Apte, 2018; Jadeja et al., 2020).

Enhancing mitochondrial function via increased NAD⁺ content is also expected to reduce oxidative stress, a major driver of cellular senescence in the RPE. Preclinical models have demonstrated that NAD⁺ precursors can ameliorate markers of senescence and inflammation in RPE cells by restoring mitochondrial membrane potential, increasing ATP production, and reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation (Ren et al., 2022; Jadeja et al., 2020). Furthermore, improved mitochondrial bioenergetics and the upregulation of transcription factors such as PGC-1α would likely contribute to a more robust antioxidant response through the regulation of NRF2 and other associated genes (Tong et al., 2022).

Additionally, increased sirtuin activity has been correlated with the regulation of several proteins involved in phagocytic processes in RPE cells. For instance, enhancing NAD⁺ levels has been shown to support the activity of proteins responsible for autophagy and lysosomal degradation, thereby potentially improving the phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments by RPE cells. This function is critical to prevent the build-up of cellular debris and toxic aggregates that can contribute to drusen formation and geographic atrophy in dry AMD (Lin & Apte, 2018; Wan et al., 2021).

Given the oral dosing of NR − which has demonstrated good bioavailability in human subjects – it is expected that systemic supplementation would translate into elevated NAD⁺ levels in ocular tissues as well. Although specific clinical evidence for dry AMD is not yet available, continued research and clinical trials in related retinal diseases (Center for Eye Research Australia, 2024; Leung, 2025) provide a foundation for expecting similar beneficial effects in dry AMD. In summary, the expected biological outcome of NR in the proposed assay is enhanced RPE viability through improved mitochondrial function, increased sirtuin-dependent autophagy, and restored phagocytic clearance of photoreceptor outer segments, which together would help slow or halt the progression of dry AMD (Lin & Apte, 2018; Jadeja et al., 2020).

Overall Evaluation:
Nicotinamide riboside emerges as a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for the treatment of dry age-related macular degeneration based on several compelling lines of evidence. Its strengths lie in its well-established ability to elevate NAD⁺ levels across multiple tissues, its excellent oral bioavailability, and its associated safety profile demonstrated in human studies. The mechanistic underpinnings—centered on NAD⁺ augmentation, sirtuin activation, and subsequent improvements in mitochondrial health and autophagy—are robustly supported by preclinical studies in retinal models and by growing clinical research in related ocular diseases (Lin & Apte, 2018; Jadeja et al., 2020).

Specifically, the reactivation of sirtuin pathways via NR supplementation is expected to enhance the autophagic clearance of photoreceptor outer segments by RPE cells, a process that is compromised in dry AMD. Improved mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis should alleviate energy deficits and reduce oxidative stress in RPE cells, thereby preserving their functionality and reducing cellular senescence. This complementary modulation of both energy metabolism and cellular quality control mechanisms is critical for a multifactorial disease such as dry AMD, which lacks effective treatment options (Jadeja et al., 2020; Lin & Apte, 2018).

Despite these strengths, some challenges and potential weaknesses remain. Direct clinical trial data supporting the efficacy of NR specifically in dry AMD patients are currently lacking. The majority of evidence stems from preclinical studies, animal models, or studies in related retinal conditions such as macula-off retinal detachment and glaucoma (Center for Eye Research Australia, 2024; Leung, 2025). While these data provide a strong scientific rationale, translational gaps must be addressed through targeted clinical trials that evaluate NR’s effect on RPE function, phagocytosis, and visual outcomes in patients with dry AMD. Additionally, while the overall safety profile of NR is favorable, long-term studies in an aging population with concurrent ocular pathology are necessary to confirm its safety and efficacy in the context of chronic administration.

Another area of potential weakness is the variability of NAD⁺ metabolism in human subjects, particularly in the advanced age groups most affected by dry AMD. Age-related declines in enzymes such as NAMPT, which are crucial for NAD⁺ salvage pathways, may affect the pharmacodynamics of NR supplementation. Research indicates that while NAD⁺ depletion is a hallmark of cellular aging, the degree of response to NAD⁺ precursors can be heterogeneous, and the therapeutic window may differ between individuals (Jadeja et al., 2018; Lin & Apte, 2018). Thus, patient stratification and biomarker studies will be essential in future clinical trials to identify those most likely to benefit from NR therapy.

Furthermore, the precise molecular mechanisms by which NR might improve RPE phagocytic function remain to be fully elucidated. Although the activation of sirtuin-dependent autophagy is a plausible explanation, additional studies are needed to clarify whether these pathways are sufficient to restore phagocytosis to pre-disease levels, or whether adjunctive therapies might be necessary. It is also important to consider that the regulation of autophagic flux in highly differentiated cells like RPE is complex and may be influenced by other factors that are not directly modulated by NR supplementation (Lin & Apte, 2018; Wan et al., 2021).

In summary, nicotinamide riboside holds significant promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry AMD. Its ability to boost NAD⁺ levels, activate sirtuin pathways, and enhance mitochondrial function forms a strong scientific basis for expecting improvements in RPE cell health and phagocytic function, which are central to mitigating dry AMD pathology. The accumulated evidence from related preclinical studies and early-phase clinical trials in ocular diseases supports further exploration of NR in dry AMD. However, it is imperative that future clinical studies are designed to directly assess the efficacy of NR in this patient population, with particular emphasis on achieving the desired modulation of cellular autophagy, mitochondrial dynamics, and RPE phagocytosis.

Overall, the strengths of NR include its established role as a safe and bioavailable NAD⁺ precursor, its robust mechanism of action involving sirtuin activation and mitochondrial protection, and supportive preclinical data in retinal models. The weaknesses center on the current lack of direct clinical evidence in dry AMD, potential variability in patient responses due to age-related metabolic changes, and the need for deeper insight into its effect on RPE phagocytic function. Taken together, nicotinamide riboside appears to be a promising candidate worthy of further investigation in the context of dry age-related macular degeneration, and its continued development could address a critical unmet need in this debilitating condition (Lin & Apte, 2018; Jadeja et al., 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

"Trehalose (catalog T9531, Sigma-Aldrich)","Proposal for Trehalose (catalog T9531, Sigma-Aldrich)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Trehalose is a naturally occurring, nonreducing disaccharide composed of two glucose molecules linked via an α-1,1 glycosidic bond. Originally discovered in various organisms such as plants, fungi, insects, and bacteria, trehalose has evolved as a stress–protective molecule that enhances cell survival under conditions of dehydration, thermal stress, and oxidative challenge. In our context, trehalose (catalog T9531, Sigma-Aldrich) is considered a repurposed therapeutic candidate, which belongs to the class of naturally derived small molecules with osmoprotectant and protein–stabilizing properties. This class of compounds has traditionally been used to preserve the structure of proteins and cell membranes in various biotechnological applications and as excipients in formulation science (Stolz et al., 2011; Cejkova & Kubinova, 2019). Trehalose has attracted attention because its biochemical properties—such as water replacement and protection against denaturation—make it ideally suited for stabilizing labile protein structures and cellular organelles. In the case of dry age–related macular degeneration (AMD), trehalose is hypothesized to act as an autophagy inducer that not only stabilizes protein aggregates in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells but also enhances the degradation capacity of these cells by facilitating TFEB-mediated lysosomal biogenesis and improving phagosome–lysosome fusion (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Abokyi et al., 2020).

Therapeutic History:
Trehalose has been used extensively in preclinical models across various fields due to its autophagy–inducing and protein–stabilizing capabilities. Biochemically, trehalose has been shown to stimulate autophagy in neuronal cells and RPE models, modulating the expression of key autophagy markers such as LC3 (microtubule–associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3) and p62/SQSTM1. Specifically, studies in human RPE cells have provided evidence for trehalose’s ability to upregulate transcription factor EB (TFEB) and downstream autophagy-related genes (Abokyi et al., 2020). In addition, preclinical models of retinal neurodegeneration have demonstrated that trehalose can reduce oxidative stress, lower protein carbonylation, and improve cellular viability under conditions of stress induced by agents such as hydroquinone—a well–established oxidant linked to dry AMD pathology (Abokyi et al., 2021). Furthermore, its application in ophthalmology extends beyond retinal diseases, as trehalose has been used topically in dry eye models, where it has been shown to protect ocular surface epithelia from desiccation and oxidative damage (Stolz et al., 2011; Cejkova & Kubinova, 2019). Although direct clinical trial evidence in human dry AMD remains limited—as many clinical trial searches reveal only a large pool of related investigations rather than focused outcomes—preclinical data in both retinal degeneration and neurodegenerative disease models strongly support further evaluation of trehalose for dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Vessey et al., 2022).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, trehalose acts primarily as an autophagy inducer that bypasses the classical mTOR–dependent mechanisms. Instead, it stimulates autophagy by eliciting mild lysosomal stress, which in turn promotes the activation of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy. TFEB, when activated, translocates to the nucleus where it upregulates genes involved in the formation of autophagosomes, lysosomal enzymes (e.g., cathepsin D), and lysosomal membrane proteins (e.g., LAMP2) (Abokyi et al., 2020; Abokyi et al., 2021). This induction of TFEB is crucial because it enhances the lysosomal clearance capacity, enabling RPE cells to degrade damaged or aggregated proteins—including lipofuscin and accumulated photoreceptor outer segments—and recycle damaged organelles under conditions of chronic oxidative stress associated with dry AMD (Kaarniranta et al., 2023).

In biochemical assays, trehalose has been shown to increase autophagic flux as evidenced by elevated levels of LC3-II and a concomitant modulation of p62 levels—a marker that is indicative of either enhanced autophagosome formation or active turnover via autolysosomal degradation. Additionally, trehalose may facilitate the clearance of toxic protein aggregates by promoting phagosome–lysosome fusion, a process essential for the degradation of photoreceptor outer segments in the RPE. This is a critical point in the pathology of dry AMD, where inefficient clearance leads to the accumulation of cytotoxic debris that exacerbates oxidative damage and inflammation (Abokyi et al., 2020; Abokyi et al., 2021).

Furthermore, trehalose’s role as a chemical chaperone enables it to stabilize protein conformations during stress conditions, thereby reducing misfolding and aggregation. This is linked with its capacity to act independently of the proteasome pathway, suggesting that its effects in clearing protein aggregates depend primarily on enhancing autophagic mechanisms coordinated by TFEB (Jeong et al., 2021). In retinal cells, particularly in the RPE, the expression of TFEB and autophagy–related genes is well documented, and trehalose’s influence on these pathways is consistent with enhanced clearance of photoreceptor debris—thus reducing drusen formation and improving overall cellular homeostasis (Abokyi et al., 2020; Vessey et al., 2022).

Expected Effect:
In the proposed assays, trehalose is expected to enhance autophagic flux in RPE cells, leading to an increased clearance of photoreceptor outer segments and a concomitant decrease in the accumulation of lipofuscin and other toxic protein aggregates. This outcome is anticipated to occur through the activation of TFEB, resulting in upregulation of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy–related genes. Enhanced autophagy is further expected to restore homeostasis in RPE cells by reducing oxidative stress and dampening inflammation—key pathological mechanisms in dry AMD (Abokyi et al., 2021).

At the molecular level, one would measure an increase in the ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I, accompanied by increased levels of lysosomal proteins such as LAMP2 and cathepsin D. Additionally, there should be evidence of nuclear translocation of TFEB, as this is a direct marker of its activation. Such changes have been quantified in previous in vitro studies in RPE models where trehalose treatment reduced protein carbonylation and oxidative stress markers (Abokyi et al., 2020; Abokyi et al., 2021). In animal models, such as those using APOE-deficient mice—which mimic certain aspects of dry AMD—the administration of trehalose has been associated with improved electroretinogram (ERG) responses without gross morphological changes in retinal layers, indicating preserved photoreceptor function due to enhanced proteostasis (Vessey et al., 2022).

In assays involving RPE cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), one would also expect stabilization of the phagocytic machinery. This entails enhancement of autophagosome formation and a boosted fusion with lysosomes, ultimately resulting in better clearance of photoreceptor outer segments. Moreover, given that RPE cells are postmitotic and particularly vulnerable to cumulative oxidative damage, improved autophagy could potentially delay or mitigate the progression of dry AMD (Abokyi et al., 2021).

Overall Evaluation:
Based on the comprehensive literature review and the preclinical evidence available, trehalose emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate for dry AMD. Its strengths lie in its natural origin, biocompatibility, and dual functionality as both an autophagy inducer and a protein–stabilizing agent. The evidence consistently shows that trehalose activates the TFEB pathway, thereby enhancing lysosomal biogenesis and autophagic flux (Jeong et al., 2021; Abokyi et al., 2020). This molecular mechanism directly addresses the pathological hallmarks of dry AMD, notably the accumulation of toxic protein aggregates and photoreceptor outer segment debris in RPE cells that lead to cell dysfunction and subsequent retinal degeneration. Its disaccharide structure ensures low toxicity and favorable ocular delivery properties, as evidenced by its use in ophthalmological applications such as dry eye treatment (Stolz et al., 2011; Cejkova & Kubinova, 2019).

However, there are also some weaknesses and challenges that need to be addressed. First, while the preclinical data are strong, clinical evidence specifically targeting dry AMD is still limited. Although several clinical trials have investigated trehalose in ocular conditions, the data in the context of retinal degeneration and RPE function are less robust. Moreover, the pharmacokinetics of trehalose, particularly its absorption and distribution in the retinal tissues upon various routes of administration, require further optimization, as oral delivery may not achieve therapeutically relevant concentrations in the retina (Jeong et al., 2021; Evans et al., 2018). Second, while activation of TFEB is desirable for enhancing autophagic clearance, uncontrolled or excessive autophagy may inadvertently lead to autophagic cell death if the pathway is overactivated. Thus, dosing regimens will have to be carefully optimized to ensure that autophagy is enhanced within a therapeutic window without tipping into cytotoxicity (Abokyi et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2020).

Furthermore, although the hypothesis emphasizes the stabilization of protein aggregates and the promotion of phagosome–lysosome fusion specifically in RPE cells, additional studies are required to dissect these processes in the complex environment of the retina. The interplay between trehalose-induced autophagy and other neuroprotective pathways—as well as its impact on inflammation—needs more in-depth characterization in both in vitro and in vivo models of dry AMD (Abokyi et al., 2020; Vessey et al., 2022).

In summary, trehalose holds significant promise as a repurposed drug candidate for dry AMD due to its ability to induce autophagy via TFEB activation, promote lysosomal biogenesis, and enhance the clearance of toxic intracellular aggregates. Its favorable biocompatibility profile and prior evidence from ophthalmological and neurodegenerative applications further support its potential. However, the limitations regarding its clinical pharmacokinetics and the necessity for precise dosing underscore the need for further translational research. Overall, trehalose is a viable candidate to pursue, and additional studies focusing on its delivery to retinal tissues, dosing optimization, and long-term efficacy in appropriate dry AMD models are warranted to validate and expand upon its therapeutic potential (Abokyi et al., 2021; Kaarniranta et al., 2023; Jeong et al., 2021).

"MCC950 (catalog vac-32588, InvivoGen)","Proposal for MCC950 (catalog vac-32588, InvivoGen)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
MCC950 is a small-molecule inhibitor originally identified as a potent and selective blocker of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Chemically, MCC950 belongs to the diarylsulfonylurea class and was discovered through phenotypic screening aimed at finding compounds that inhibit interleukin-1β (IL-1β) processing—a crucial mediator in inflammatory responses. The synthesis of MCC950 involved modification of sulfonylurea structures, evolving from earlier sulfonylurea compounds such as glyburide, to yield a molecule with enhanced specificity and potency toward NLRP3 (Coll et al., 2015, pp. 1–2). MCC950’s design capitalizes on its central sulfonylurea scaffold, which facilitates hydrogen bonding and crucial hydrophobic interactions with the target protein’s nucleotide‐binding domain. Historically, sulfonylurea derivatives have been used primarily as antidiabetic agents due to their insulin secretagogue effects; however, the subclass of diarylsulfonylureas, including MCC950, has been repurposed and optimized for anti‐inflammatory applications via selective inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome (Agarwal et al., 2020, pp. 3–6; Coll et al., 2015, pp. 2–4). Its chemical structure, characterized by a hexahydroindacene moiety linked to a sulfonylurea core and a furan substituent, defines its molecular identity and has provided a template for subsequent analog development. This synthetic origin underscores the potential for medicinal chemistry optimization both in terms of potency and relative pharmacokinetic properties.

Therapeutic History:
The primary use of MCC950 has been in the context of inflammatory diseases driven by aberrant activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Over the past decade, extensive preclinical studies have demonstrated that MCC950 is effective in reducing IL-1β and IL-18 secretion in various in vitro and animal models of autoinflammatory, metabolic, and neurodegenerative conditions (Coll et al., 2015, pp. 8–9; Vande Walle et al., 2019, pp. 1–2). Its potent inhibition of NLRP3 activation has been validated in disease models such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis for multiple sclerosis and murine models of cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) (Baldwin et al., 2016, pp. 8–11; Perera et al., 2018, pp. 1–2). Although MCC950 has not been clinically tested specifically for dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD), its robust efficacy in mitigating inflammation in non‐ocular models and its proven ability to penetrate ocular tissues in nonhuman primate models of ocular inflammation suggest translational potential for retinal diseases. The anti‐inflammatory profile of MCC950, particularly in terms of inhibiting the caspase-1 activation and IL‐1β processing, has led to clinical interest in applications that extend beyond its initial target indications. Notably, small-molecule inhibitors of NLRP3 like MCC950 have been highlighted for their oral bioavailability and lack of interference with other inflammasome pathways, which classic biologics such as IL-1β neutralizing antibodies do not offer (Coll et al., 2015, pp. 22–26; Vande Walle et al., 2019, pp. 23–24). While previous uses of MCC950 or similar diarylsulfonylurea compounds have been focused on systemic inflammatory conditions, the mechanistic insights regarding NLRP3 involvement in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) dysfunction and AMD pathogenesis are emerging, and preclinical studies have increasingly supported the repurposing of inflammasome inhibitors as therapeutic agents for dry AMD (Kaur et al., 2025, pp. 14–16; Xu et al., 2023, pp. 18–29).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, MCC950 exerts its therapeutic effect by targeting the NACHT domain of the NLRP3 inflammasome—a critical region responsible for ATP hydrolysis and subsequent inflammasome oligomerization. MCC950 binds directly to the ATP-binding cassette within the NACHT domain, particularly interacting with motifs such as the Walker B motif, thereby preventing the conformational change necessary for NLRP3 activation (Baldwin et al., 2016, pp. 8–11; Zhan et al., 2023, pp. 7–8). This binding stabilizes NLRP3 in an inactive “closed” conformation, ultimately blocking the oligomerization of the adaptor protein ASC and inhibiting caspase-1 activation. Because caspase-1 activation is essential for the cleavage of pro-IL-1β into its mature form, MCC950 indirectly prevents the release of IL-1β and IL-18, key mediators of inflammation (El-Sayed et al., 2022, pp. 3–4; Coll et al., 2015, pp. 4–6). Moreover, MCC950’s mechanism of action is highly selective; it does not interfere with other inflammasomes such as NLRC4 or AIM2, ensuring that the normal host defense mechanisms are preserved (Vande Walle et al., 2019, pp. 2–3; Perera et al., 2018, pp. 2–4). Recent structural studies have further revealed that MCC950’s interactions involve multiple hydrophobic contacts and hydrogen bonds within the NACHT domain, which contribute to its high affinity and selectivity (Kaur et al., 2025, pp. 6–8; Keuler et al., 2022, pp. 4–5). The detailed molecular insights imply that by preventing the ATPase activity of NLRP3, MCC950 halts the downstream inflammatory cascade that would otherwise aggravate tissue damage in chronic inflammatory diseases. Although some reports note that MCC950 may have limited effects on specific gain-of-function NLRP3 mutants (as seen in certain CAPS cases), its efficacy on wild-type NLRP3—relevant to sterile inflammatory conditions such as those observed in dry AMD—remains robust (Vande Walle et al., 2019, pp. 15–17; Wu et al., 2020, pp. 1–3).

Expected Effect:
In the context of dry age-related macular degeneration, the hypothesis is that MCC950 will alleviate chronic inflammation in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) by inhibiting NLRP3-dependent IL-1β secretion. NLRP3 activation in RPE cells is known to impair the normal phagocytic function of these cells and contribute to a pro-inflammatory microenvironment that exacerbates the accumulation of photoreceptor debris—a critical factor in the pathogenesis of dry AMD (Kaur et al., 2025, pp. 40–46). By blocking the ATPase activity of NLRP3, MCC950 is expected to restore the expression and function of phagocytic receptors that become suppressed under chronic inflammatory conditions. The effect is hypothesized to manifest as an indirect enhancement in the clearance of photoreceptor outer segments, thereby slowing or even reversing the accumulation of cellular debris that contributes to RPE dysfunction. Additionally, preclinical models have demonstrated that restoration of phagocytic gene expression in RPE is achievable through specific inhibition of inflammatory checkpoints, which in turn may lead to a reduction in secondary degenerative changes such as geographic atrophy (Harrison et al., 2020, pp. 1–2; Perera et al., 2018, pp. 9–10). Studies in other inflammatory models have shown that oral administration of MCC950 significantly reduces localized inflammation without broadly immunosuppressing the host, thereby supporting its use as a targeted therapeutic for ocular inflammatory conditions (Coll et al., 2015, pp. 6–8; Xu et al., 2023, pp. 6–7). It is important to note that RPE cells express NLRP3 and its downstream effectors, implying that direct inhibition could modulate critical signaling pathways involved in both inflammasome assembly and phagocytosis (Baldwin et al., 2016, pp. 8–11; Wu et al., 2020, pp. 6–7). The expected outcome in the proposed assay is a reduction in IL-1β levels, an improvement in RPE receptor expression profiles, and an enhanced clearance of debris, which collectively may contribute to a stabilization or improvement in retinal function in a dry AMD setting.

Overall Evaluation:
From the gathered literature and mechanistic insights, MCC950 appears to be a highly promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of dry age-related macular degeneration. One of the primary strengths of MCC950 is its well-defined mechanism of action, which involves direct inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome by binding to the NACHT domain and blocking ATPase activity. This targeted inhibition leads to a significant reduction in caspase-1 activation and IL-1β/IL-18 cytokine maturation, processes that are key drivers of chronic inflammation and associated tissue damage (Coll et al., 2015, pp. 8–9; Vande Walle et al., 2019, pp. 23–24). The high specificity of MCC950 ensures minimal off-target effects compared to broader anti-inflammatory agents, which is crucial for maintaining normal immune responses in the retina and systemically (Baldwin et al., 2016, pp. 8–11; Wu et al., 2020, pp. 1–3).

Another significant strength is the extensive preclinical evidence supporting its anti-inflammatory efficacy across multiple disease models—including those that mimic inflammatory ocular conditions. Although dry AMD has unique pathophysiological features related to RPE dysfunction and extracellular debris accumulation, the underlying chronic inflammatory process driven by NLRP3 activation is shared across several inflammatory disorders. This translational overlap suggests that MCC950’s ability to restore RPE phagocytosis and reduce inflammatory cytokine production could translate effectively into therapeutic outcomes for dry AMD (Kaur et al., 2025, pp. 14–16; Xu et al., 2023, pp. 18–29).

Furthermore, MCC950 has demonstrated desirable pharmacokinetic properties, including oral bioavailability and tissue penetration in nonhuman primate ocular inflammation models. This is particularly important for a chronic condition such as dry AMD, where long-term oral administration is preferable over invasive treatments. The use of a small-molecule inhibitor such as MCC950 offers practical advantages over biologics, which are often limited by cost, administration route, and immunogenicity (Coll et al., 2015, pp. 1–2; Vande Walle et al., 2019, pp. 1–2).

Nevertheless, there are important considerations that need to be addressed. One potential weakness is the observation that MCC950 exhibits reduced efficacy against certain gain-of-function NLRP3 mutants, as highlighted in some studies. However, in the case of dry AMD—which is generally associated with wild-type NLRP3 activation rather than mutant forms—this limitation may be less critical (Vande Walle et al., 2019, pp. 15–17; Wu et al., 2020, pp. 1–3). Additionally, there has been concern regarding hepatotoxicity in some clinical contexts, as seen in earlier phase trials for rheumatoid arthritis, raising safety considerations for chronic systemic use. Nonetheless, given the localized nature of retinal pathology, careful dosing or targeted delivery strategies (e.g., via ocular formulations) may mitigate potential systemic side effects while ensuring sufficient drug levels at the site of pathology (Xu et al., 2023, pp. 18–29; Perera et al., 2018, pp. 9–10).

Another area requiring further validation is the link between NLRP3-mediated inflammation and the suppression of phagocytic receptors in RPE cells. While emerging preclinical studies indicate that NLRP3 activation impairs RPE function—likely via IL-1β–driven processes—the precise molecular relationship and downstream signaling events remain under active investigation. It will be crucial to verify whether MCC950 can restore normal phagocytosis and clearance of photoreceptor debris in robust preclinical AMD models. The proposed mechanism, whereby inhibition of IL-1β alleviates secondary suppression of phagocytic receptors, is biologically plausible given the established literature on inflammasome-driven cytokine cascades and RPE dysfunction (Kaur et al., 2025, pp. 40–46; Coll et al., 2015, pp. 22–26).

Moreover, the direct inhibition of NLRP3 by MCC950 has been shown to modulate systemic inflammatory responses without interfering with upstream ion fluxes such as potassium or chloride efflux, which are critical for normal cellular homeostasis. With its mechanism focusing on directly stabilizing NLRP3 in an inactive conformation, MCC950 presents minimal risk to physiological processes that rely on these ionic changes (Wu et al., 2020, pp. 3–4; Zhan et al., 2023, pp. 7–8). This implies that its therapeutic window in chronic conditions like dry AMD might be favorable if dosing strategies are optimized for retinal delivery while minimizing systemic exposure.

In terms of translational feasibility, the candidate’s small-molecule nature enhances manufacturability and scalability in a clinical development setting. Its defined chemical structure, amenability to oral administration, and documented efficacy in other inflammatory disease models together provide a compelling rationale for advancing further preclinical studies in dry AMD. The emphasis on targeting a specific inflammasome checkpoint represents a novel mechanistic approach compared to existing broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory agents, which often come with considerable side effects and suboptimal efficacy in degenerative retinal diseases (Coll et al., 2015, pp. 4–6; Xu et al., 2023, pp. 6–7).

Overall, the evidence supports that MCC950 is a promising therapeutic candidate for dry age-related macular degeneration. Its natural origins from repurposed sulfonylurea scaffolds, extensive preclinical validation in non-ocular inflammatory models, and detailed molecular mechanism targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome constitute significant strengths. However, further studies in relevant AMD models are essential to confirm its ability to restore RPE phagocytosis and improve photoreceptor debris clearance while carefully monitoring for potential systemic side effects, particularly hepatotoxicity. In summary, while challenges remain regarding safety optimization and validation of efficacy in ocular models, MCC950 presents a mechanistically specific and translationally feasible approach to treating dry AMD by modulating inflammasome-driven inflammation in the retinal pigment epithelium (Coll et al., 2015, pp. 6–8; Vande Walle et al., 2019, pp. 23–24; Kaur et al., 2025, pp. 17–19).

Below is a comprehensive evaluation of resveratrol (catalog R5010, Sigma-Aldrich) as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD). The evaluation is organized into five sections: an","Proposal for Resveratrol (catalog R5010, Sigma-Aldrich)

Below is a comprehensive evaluation of resveratrol (catalog R5010, Sigma-Aldrich) as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD). The evaluation is organized into five sections: an overview of the candidate’s origins and class, its therapeutic history, its mechanism of action in molecular detail, the expected cellular and tissue-level effects in RPE cells (the critical cell type in dry AMD), and an overall evaluation highlighting strengths and weaknesses.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Resveratrol is a naturally occurring polyphenolic stilbene that was originally isolated from grape skins and red wine. Its chemical structure, 3,5,4′‐trihydroxy-trans-stilbene, was characterized during early investigations into natural compounds with antioxidant and anti‐aging properties. As a member of the polyphenol class, resveratrol has been shown to exhibit broad pleiotropic effects—including anti-inflammatory, anticancer, cardioprotective, and neuroprotective properties—which have been extensively explored in preclinical studies. In addition to its natural abundance, synthetic and semisynthetic methods have made resveratrol accessible for research applications. Compounds of this class have traditionally been used to mitigate oxidative stress and promote cellular longevity in a variety of organ systems. Their known ability to activate key regulators of metabolism and stress responses, such as SIRT1, places them at the forefront of efforts to protect cells from age‐related degeneration. This has generated significant interest in repurposing resveratrol for retinal diseases, particularly those characterized by chronic oxidative stress and compromised autophagy, such as dry AMD (Bola et al., 2014; Delmas et al., 2021).

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic history of resveratrol spans preclinical biochemical studies, animal models, and early-phase clinical trials. Previously, resveratrol has been evaluated in multiple clinical trials for metabolic syndromes and cardiovascular conditions, where it demonstrated improvements in insulin sensitivity, reductions in systemic inflammation, and favorable shifts in oxidative stress biomarkers. In the ocular realm, several preclinical investigations have focused on its protective effects in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, which are crucial to maintaining central retinal health. For example, experimental studies have documented that resveratrol prevents oxidative stress–induced mitochondrial dysfunction in RPE cells by preserving mitochondrial membrane potential and reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (Bilbao-Malavé et al., 2021). Further, animal studies have shown that resveratrol treatment is associated with improved retinal structure and function, including enhanced photoreceptor survival in models where RPE oxidative damage is a central feature. Although clinical studies thus far have primarily investigated resveratrol’s impact on exudative (wet) AMD—as evidenced by trials such as those registered under NCT04756310 and NCT05062486—the underlying mechanistic targets (enhancement of autophagy, improvement of mitochondrial quality, and reduction of oxidative damage) are precisely those that are disrupted in dry AMD. In conditions such as dry AMD, where chronic oxidative stress leads to RPE degeneration and accumulation of toxic photoreceptor debris, repurposing resveratrol is especially appealing since its history of ocular protective effects strongly suggests it could be beneficial for this indication (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2014; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021).

Mechanism of Action:
Resveratrol’s potential in dry AMD is largely based on its well‐characterized mechanism of action as an activator of SIRT1, an NAD⁺-dependent deacetylase that modulates a host of cellular processes tied to aging, stress resistance, and mitochondrial homeostasis. At the molecular level, resveratrol has been shown to enhance the deacetylation of critical regulators such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) and certain Forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors. The deacetylation of PGC-1α is directly responsible for upregulating mitochondrial biogenesis and increasing the expression of endogenous antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase. In addition to directly modulating SIRT1, resveratrol activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key cellular energy sensor that, upon activation, suppresses mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). The inhibition of mTORC1 relieves its suppressive effects on autophagy, thereby enhancing the autophagic flux necessary for the clearance of damaged organelles and aggregated proteins. In the context of RPE cells, these dual actions are critical: enhanced mitochondrial function supports the high energy demands of photoreceptor outer segment phagocytosis, while improved autophagy via increased fusion of phagosomes with lysosomes facilitates the clearance of photoreceptor debris. Moreover, resveratrol has been documented to reduce the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as interleukin-8) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) through modulation of pathways including MAPK/ERK signaling. This anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic activity further contributes to the stabilization of the retinal microenvironment, potentially curtailing any low-grade inflammatory drive that exacerbates RPE degeneration (Josifovska et al., 2020; Koskela et al., 2016; Bilbao-Malavé et al., 2021). Furthermore, studies indicate that SIRT1 activation by resveratrol can promote beneficial epigenetic modifications and maintain DNA methylation stability, which indirectly supports RPE cell longevity (Delmas et al., 2021; Kaarniranta et al., 2018). Altogether, the coordinated activation of SIRT1 and AMPK by resveratrol initiates a multipronged cellular defense: it boosts mitochondrial biogenesis, promotes the degradation of damaged cellular components via autophagy, and reduces oxidative and inflammatory insults—all of which are crucial for safeguarding RPE cell function under stress conditions typical of dry AMD (Bilbao-Malavé et al., 2021; Nita & Grzybowski, 2023).

Expected Effect:
Based on its mechanism of action, the hypothesis is that resveratrol administration will have several beneficial outcomes in RPE cells, which can translate into clinical benefits for patients with dry AMD. First, by activating SIRT1 and AMPK, resveratrol is expected to enhance mitochondrial biogenesis and preserve mitochondrial membrane potential. RPE cells, which are tasked with the substantial metabolic burden of daily photoreceptor outer segment phagocytosis, require highly robust mitochondrial function to meet their energy needs. Improved mitochondrial function would thus help these cells resist oxidative damage and delay the onset of mitochondrial dysfunction—a known contributor to dry AMD pathology (Kaarniranta et al., 2018). Second, the promotion of autophagic flux by resveratrol through mTOR inhibition is anticipated to result in an increased rate of phagosome–lysosome fusion, which is essential for clearing toxic debris from photoreceptor outer segment turnover. In cell-based assays, one would expect to observe an increase in the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II along with a reduction in p62 levels, indicating enhanced autophagic degradation. These changes would correlate with a decrease in lipofuscin accumulation and other markers of oxidative damage in the RPE (Pinelli et al., 2023).

Additionally, resveratrol’s anti-inflammatory effects should lead to a measurable decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-8, as well as a reduction in VEGF levels. This anti-inflammatory milieu is expected to help stabilize the local retinal environment, reducing the chronic low-grade inflammation that contributes to RPE degeneration in dry AMD (Bola et al., 2014; Nagineni et al., 2014). Experimental models simulating light-induced oxidative stress have further corroborated resveratrol’s ability to protect retinal cells by blocking both caspase-dependent and PARP-dependent cell death pathways. For instance, under conditions mimicking the high oxidative burden of the retina, treatment with resveratrol has resulted in improved photoreceptor survival and preserved outer nuclear layer thickness in animal studies, suggesting that similar protective effects could be harnessed in RPE cells (Subramani et al., 2017; Tong et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2018).

At the level of a cell assay, one would expect that an RPE culture treated with resveratrol will show improved mitochondrial parameters (e.g., increased membrane potential and ATP production), enhanced autophagic markers (e.g., elevated LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, decreased p62), and reduced oxidative stress markers (e.g., lower levels of ROS and malondialdehyde). In addition, gene expression analyses may reveal downregulation of inflammatory mediators and upregulation of antioxidant enzymes. Collectively, these changes should contribute to improved cell survival and function, ultimately mitigating the degenerative processes observed in dry AMD (Kaarniranta et al., 2018; Luján et al., 2022; Nita & Grzybowski, 2023; Pinelli et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
Considering the extensive preclinical evidence and the mechanistic rationale, resveratrol emerges as a promising candidate for repurposing in dry AMD therapy. One of its significant strengths is the dual activation of the SIRT1 and AMPK pathways, which has been consistently shown to improve mitochondrial homeostasis and stimulate autophagic clearance in various cell types, including RPE cells. Such effects directly address major defects in dry AMD, namely chronic oxidative damage, accumulation of toxic photoreceptor debris, and RPE dysfunction secondary to compromised autophagy (Delmas et al., 2021; Kaarniranta et al., 2018).

Another notable strength is resveratrol’s anti-inflammatory profile. By downregulating key mediators like IL-8 and VEGF, resveratrol helps to create a retinal microenvironment less prone to inflammation. Even though dry AMD is typically characterized by the absence of overt neovascularization, low-grade inflammation remains a driving force in the progression of RPE degeneration. Thus, the inhibition of pro-inflammatory signaling pathways adds an additional protective benefit that could slow the disease course (Bola et al., 2014; Nagineni et al., 2014).

Moreover, several studies have shown that resveratrol is capable of promoting phagosome–lysosome fusion and enhancing the autophagic flux in RPE cells. This facet of its mechanism is particularly attractive because one of the hallmarks of dry AMD is the impaired clearance of photoreceptor outer segments, leading to lipofuscin accumulation and eventual cell dysfunction. Experimental data suggest that resveratrol-treated cells exhibit enhanced degradation of damaged organelles, correlating with improved cellular viability under conditions of oxidative stress (Josifovska et al., 2020; Koskela et al., 2016).

The safety profile of resveratrol further supports its potential repurposing. Clinical trials in non-ocular indications, including those for metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, have generally reported a favorable safety and tolerability profile, especially in the elderly—who form the primary population affected by dry AMD. While it is recognized that resveratrol suffers from low bioavailability when administered orally, ongoing research into novel delivery modalities (such as nanoparticle encapsulation, topical formulations, or intraocular implants) is producing promising strategies to overcome this pharmacokinetic barrier (Luján et al., 2022; Pinelli et al., 2023).

Nevertheless, there are challenges that must be acknowledged. Resveratrol’s rapid metabolism and low systemic bioavailability remain significant obstacles. Achieving therapeutically relevant concentrations in the retina after systemic administration is problematic; hence, optimizing ocular delivery methods will be a critical component of its further development. Additionally, while there is substantial preclinical evidence supporting its efficacy, direct clinical data in patients with dry AMD are still sparse. Although trials such as those registered under NCT04756310 and NCT05062486 have evaluated resveratrol-containing formulations in ocular disease contexts, the majority of robust efficacy data have so far been limited to animal models and in vitro studies (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2014; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021; Bilbao-Malavé et al., 2021).

Furthermore, the multifactorial nature of dry AMD poses an inherent challenge. Dry AMD arises from an interplay of genetic predispositions, environmental factors, and systemic metabolic derangements. It is improbable that a single therapeutic agent, regardless of its potent mechanistic effects, will be sufficient to reverse or halt all pathogenic processes in this complex disease. It is thus likely that resveratrol may ultimately need to be used in combination with other therapeutic agents—such as other antioxidants, anti-inflammatory drugs, or compounds that further augment autophagy—to achieve a clinically meaningful effect. Nonetheless, the fact that resveratrol can directly target several of the central pathogenic mechanisms gives it a strong rationale for continued research as part of a multimodal therapy approach (Delmas et al., 2021; Kaarniranta et al., 2018).

Another consideration is the translation of in vitro and animal model findings to the human clinical scenario. Differences in dosing, pharmacodynamics, and the long-term progression of dry AMD require that extensive clinical trials be conducted to fully characterize the therapeutic index and sustained efficacy of resveratrol in the human retina. It is also important to evaluate the impact of chronic administration, as dry AMD is a slowly progressive disease that may necessitate long-term treatment before tangible benefits are observed. Moreover, understanding the potential adverse interactions that might occur in complex treatment regimens for an elderly population is critical for overall drug development.

Despite these challenges, the multipronged benefits of resveratrol—encompassing improved mitochondrial biogenesis, enhanced autophagy, decreased oxidative stress, and anti-inflammatory actions—present a compelling rationale for its repurposing in dry AMD. Its mechanism of action directly addresses several pivotal failures in RPE cell function that contribute to the pathogenesis of dry AMD. The evidence from biochemical and preclinical studies supports the idea that resveratrol can restore RPE homeostasis by promoting the clearance of photoreceptor debris and by mitigating the chronic oxidative and inflammatory damage that undermines retinal health (Bilbao-Malavé et al., 2021; Nita & Grzybowski, 2023; Pinelli et al., 2023).

In summary, from a drug development perspective, resveratrol represents an attractive candidate for repurposing in dry AMD owing to its well-characterized activation of SIRT1 and AMPK, its demonstrated ability to enhance autophagic flux and mitochondrial quality, and its anti-inflammatory properties. The strengths of resveratrol lie in its multifaceted mechanism of action, which is precisely aligned with the major pathogenic processes in dry AMD, and its favorable safety profile observed in other clinical contexts. The primary weaknesses that need to be addressed are its low bioavailability and the current paucity of direct clinical evidence in dry AMD patients. Future research should be directed toward optimizing delivery methods to increase ocular exposure, conducting rigorous clinical studies to establish dosing regimens, and potentially evaluating combination therapies that leverage resveratrol’s mechanisms in synergy with other agents.

Overall, the current literature strongly supports further investigation into resveratrol as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry AMD. Its capacity to modulate key cellular survival and stress response pathways—especially the activation of SIRT1 and AMPK, enhancement of autophagic clearance, and improvement of mitochondrial function—forms a robust scientific foundation that justifies advancing resveratrol into targeted, hypothesis-driven clinical trials. With the appropriate formulation strategies to overcome pharmacokinetic limitations, resveratrol has the potential to address the multifactorial pathology of dry AMD and provide clinical benefit to patients suffering from this degenerative retinal disease (Bilbao-Malavé et al., 2021; Nita & Grzybowski, 2023; Pinelli et al., 2023).

This comprehensive evaluation, integrating data from biochemical studies, in vitro assays, animal models, and early-phase clinical investigations, underscores that resveratrol’s pleiotropic effects on key intracellular pathways make it an appealing candidate for addressing the complex pathophysiology of dry AMD. Continued research, with an emphasis on improving ocular bioavailability and validating long-term efficacy in well-designed clinical trials, will be crucial in determining whether resveratrol can fulfill its promising role in ameliorating RPE degeneration and preserving central vision in patients with dry AMD.

"Rolipram (catalog R0343, Sigma-Aldrich)","Proposal for Rolipram (catalog R0343, Sigma-Aldrich)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Rolipram is a synthetic small-molecule inhibitor that belongs to the class of selective phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitors. It was originally discovered during drug development efforts aimed at modulating cyclic nucleotide signaling in the central nervous system. As a member of the PDE4 inhibitor class, Rolipram was synthesized and characterized for its ability to inhibit the enzymatic activity of phosphodiesterase 4, thereby preventing the hydrolysis of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The compound’s chemical origins lie in systematic structure–activity relationship studies that modified the chemical scaffold to increase PDE4 selectivity while achieving an acceptable safety profile. Historically, PDE4 inhibitors have been explored for their anti‐inflammatory and neuroprotective effects, with Rolipram emerging as the prototypical molecule in this class. It has been used extensively as a pharmacological tool to understand the regulation of cAMP signaling pathways in a variety of cell types, and its chemical properties—such as a relatively low molecular weight—support good tissue penetration, including the potential to cross the blood–brain barrier and possibly, in ocular applications, to permeate retinal tissues (Luu et al., 2023; Luu, 2024).

Therapeutic History:
Rolipram has a well-documented history in the fields of neuroscience and immunology. In preclinical studies, it has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects and to promote neuroprotection by elevating intracellular cAMP levels. Clinically, Rolipram was originally evaluated in Phase I and II clinical trials for major depressive disorder, where its efficacy was counterbalanced by side effects such as nausea and emesis in some patient populations; however, its safety and tolerability at controlled doses were acceptable in a subset of patients (Luu et al., 2023). Although not originally developed for ocular indications, the mechanistic rationale supports repurposing Rolipram for dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), particularly given the unmet need for effective treatments in this degenerative retinal disease. Despite extensive preclinical studies using Rolipram in models of neurodegeneration and inflammation, there are currently no registered clinical trials investigating its use specifically for dry AMD or RPE dysfunction, as confirmed by a thorough search of ClinicalTrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). However, the biochemical and translational studies performed in animal models of retinal degeneration—including those that mimic key features of dry AMD such as photoreceptor degeneration and RPE dysfunction—indicate that selective PDE4 inhibition by Rolipram holds considerable promise for ameliorating retinal damage (Luu et al., 2023; Luu, 2024).

Mechanism of Action:
The primary mechanism of action for Rolipram involves the selective inhibition of PDE4, an enzyme that is responsible for the degradation of intracellular cAMP. By inhibiting PDE4, Rolipram elevates the intracellular concentration of cAMP, which in turn activates downstream signaling cascades that are mediated via effectors such as protein kinase A (PKA) and exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP (Epac). Elevated cAMP levels have been implicated in several cellular processes critical to retinal health, particularly in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells. The activation of PKA leads to the phosphorylation of a number of transcription factors and other substrate proteins, including the cAMP-responsive element binding protein 1 (CREB1); phosphorylation of CREB1, especially at serine residues S133 and S271, is known to promote gene transcription related to cell survival, somatic maintenance, and anti-apoptotic pathways (Luu, 2024). Simultaneously, the activation of the Epac pathway contributes to cytoskeletal reorganization and enhances vesicular trafficking events such as phagosome formation and lysosomal fusion. These processes are critical for the RPE’s role in the clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (POS); improper degradation of POS is a central feature in the pathogenesis of dry AMD (Luu et al., 2023; Luu, 2024). Preclinical studies have demonstrated that PDE4 inhibition is able to normalize stress-induced transcriptomic and proteomic alterations in retinal cells, thereby mitigating apoptotic pathways, reducing levels of inflammatory mediators, and preserving the structural integrity of the retina (Luu, 2024; Luu et al., 2023). In vitro work with human ARPE-19 cells has shown that exposure to toxic visual cycle byproducts such as all-trans-retinal (atRAL) causes cytotoxic calcium elevation and oxidative stress, both of which are ameliorated by treatment with PDE inhibitors like Rolipram; this suggests that the drug’s mechanism not only encompasses anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory actions but also extends to stabilizing intracellular calcium levels and promoting the restoration of normal RPE function (Luu et al., 2023; Luu, 2024).

Expected Effect:
Given the underlying hypothesis, the application of Rolipram in dry AMD is expected to elevate cAMP levels in RPE cells, thereby activating PKA and Epac signaling cascades. This activation is predicted to promote key intracellular trafficking processes, specifically enhancing phagosome formation, lysosomal fusion, and the efficient degradation of photoreceptor outer segments. In the context of dry AMD, where RPE dysfunction leads to the accumulation of extracellular debris (drusen) and an impaired clearance of POS, such an enhancement in phagocytic capacity could restore cellular homeostasis and reduce retinal stress (Luu et al., 2023; Liton et al., 2023). Preclinical models, including murine double knockout (dKO) mice that mimic the degenerative features of dry AMD, have shown that PDE4 inhibitors can preserve retinal structure and function as observed through optical coherence tomography (OCT), scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO), and electroretinography (ERG) assessments (Luu et al., 2023; Luu, 2024). These functional improvements are correlated with a reduction in stress-induced apoptotic signaling and a preservation of key survival factors such as glutamine synthetase (GLUL) and rod-derived cone viability factor (RdCVF/NXNL1). In addition, the cellular models indicate that the genes coding for proteins involved in the phagocytic machinery are expressed in RPE cells, thereby supporting the notion that pharmacologically driven cAMP elevation through Rolipram treatment could enhance the degradation pathways of POS (Luu et al., 2023; Luu, 2024). Importantly, Rolipram is also known to have CNS penetration and an acceptable safety profile from prior clinical trials in psychiatric indications, which further supports its potential for repurposing in retinal applications since the dosing required to achieve ocular effects might be lower or target-specific adaptations (Luu et al., 2023). Therefore, the expected effect of Rolipram is multifactorial: it should restore proper RPE function by improving the processing and clearance of photoreceptor debris, reduce oxidative and inflammatory stress in retinal cells, and ultimately slow or prevent the progression of photoreceptor degeneration typically observed in dry AMD (Luu, 2024; Luu et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
Based on the comprehensive review of the literature across biochemical, clinical, and translational studies provided above, Rolipram emerges as a promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of dry age-related macular degeneration. A significant strength of this therapeutic candidate is its well-established mechanism of action as a selective PDE4 inhibitor that elevates intracellular cAMP levels, thereby activating downstream PKA and Epac pathways critical for cellular survival, anti-apoptotic responses, and enhanced phagocytosis in RPE cells (Luu, 2024; Luu et al., 2023). This mechanistic insight is further bolstered by preclinical evidence indicating that modulation of cAMP signaling can restore key cellular functions in the retina that are compromised in dry AMD, such as the clearance of photoreceptor outer segments via enhanced phagosome formation and lysosomal degradation (Luu et al., 2023; Luu, 2024).

Another advantage is Rolipram’s relatively well-known pharmacokinetic and safety profile from prior clinical trials in major depressive disorder, which provides a translational foundation that may mitigate some of the uncertainties associated with novel compounds. Its small molecular weight and ability to cross the blood–brain barrier may also suggest that it could be formulated to achieve ocular penetration, potentially through localized delivery methods such as intravitreal sustained-release formulations or optimized systemic dosing strategies (Luu et al., 2023; Luu, 2024). These factors collectively support the feasibility of advancing Rolipram into further preclinical studies and, eventually, clinical trials focused on dry AMD.

Nevertheless, there are notable weaknesses and areas of uncertainty that warrant careful consideration. First, while the preclinical data are promising, there is an absence of direct clinical trial data assessing Rolipram in patients with dry AMD, as confirmed by searches on ClinicalTrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). This represents a gap in translational evidence that must be addressed before full clinical adoption can be considered. Furthermore, side effects such as nausea and emesis, although possibly manageable with lower or targeted doses, have historically limited the clinical utility of Rolipram in its original indication for depression. It will be essential to ascertain whether similar adverse effects might occur when the drug is repurposed for ocular administration, and if so, whether formulation strategies (for example, localized administration) can mitigate these effects (Luu et al., 2023).

Another point to consider is the specificity of Rolipram’s action in the retinal context. Although the mechanistic rationale is clear and supported by evidence showing that PDE4 inhibition enhances cAMP-mediated pathways in RPE cells, the actual impact on RPE-specific phagocytic activity has been inferred rather than directly demonstrated in all studies. Further studies that clearly measure phagosome formation, lysosomal fusion, and the degradation of photoreceptor outer segments in RPE cells in vitro and in relevant animal models are needed to solidify the link between Rolipram’s molecular effects and clinical outcomes in dry AMD (Luu, 2024; Luu et al., 2023). Additionally, while the upregulation of survival factors such as GLUL and RdCVF in stressed retinal cells is encouraging, the robustness and reproducibility of these effects in human tissues remain to be determined.

On the translational front, the safety profile from non-ocular applications of Rolipram is advantageous; however, the conditions in which retinal cells operate are unique. RPE cells have high metabolic demands and are continuously exposed to oxidative stress and phototoxic insults, which means that any pharmacological intervention must not only be efficacious but also maintain a favorable risk–benefit ratio over long-term use. Moreover, the complexity of dry AMD pathogenesis—encompassing not only RPE dysfunction but also choroidal vascular changes and inflammation—may necessitate combination therapies rather than relying on a monotherapy approach with a PDE4 inhibitor alone (Luu, 2024).

In summary, Rolipram presents several compelling strengths as a therapeutic candidate for dry AMD. Its ability to elevate intracellular cAMP and activate the PKA and Epac pathways aligns well with the current understanding of RPE cell biology and the molecular pathogenesis of dry AMD. Preclinical studies provide supportive evidence indicating that PDE4 inhibition can restore retinal homeostasis by enhancing the clearance of damaged photoreceptor outer segments and suppressing stress-induced apoptotic pathways. Furthermore, its established safety profile in previous clinical settings reduces some of the barriers to repurposing this molecule for retinal applications. On the other hand, the current lack of clinical trial data specifically addressing its efficacy in dry AMD, potential tolerability issues, and the need for further mechanistic studies in RPE-specific contexts are significant considerations that must be addressed as the research progresses. Overall, Rolipram has substantial potential as a repurposed drug candidate for dry AMD, provided that future preclinical studies can refine its dosing and delivery strategies and confirm its efficacy on RPE phagocytosis and lysosomal function in both animal models and human tissues (Luu et al., 2023; Luu, 2024; Liton et al., 2023; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Given the extensive mechanistic rationale and the encouraging results from retinal degeneration models, further investigation into Rolipram’s repurposing for dry AMD is warranted. The next steps should include detailed in vitro studies employing human RPE cells to directly measure improvements in phagosome formation, lysosomal fusion, and outer segment degradation upon Rolipram treatment. Concurrently, refined preclinical animal studies using targeted ocular delivery methods may help to ascertain the optimal dosing regimen that maximizes efficacy while minimizing systemic side effects. Attending to these details in future studies may ultimately pave the way for early-phase clinical trials that could validate Rolipram as a novel treatment for dry AMD—an area of significant unmet medical need (Luu, 2024; Luu et al., 2023).

Overall, Rolipram is a scientifically promising and mechanistically compelling therapeutic candidate for dry AMD, with notable strengths such as its precise molecular action on cAMP signaling and a well-established history in other clinical applications. However, its translational success will depend on overcoming the challenges posed by its known side effect profile and establishing clear evidence of its effects on RPE-specific functions relevant to dry AMD. Future research efforts should concentrate on bridging the gap between preclinical promise and clinical application to determine whether Rolipram can indeed offer a viable, disease-modifying treatment for patients suffering from this debilitating retinal disorder (Luu et al., 2023; Luu, 2024).

"Sulforaphane (catalog S4441, Sigma-Aldrich)","Proposal for Sulforaphane (catalog S4441, Sigma-Aldrich)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Sulforaphane (catalog S4441, Sigma-Aldrich) is a naturally occurring isothiocyanate originally isolated from cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli and Brussels sprouts. It is formed by the enzymatic hydrolysis of glucoraphanin by the plant enzyme myrosinase during mechanical processing (e.g., chopping or chewing), leading to the release of sulforaphane. This compound belongs to the class of phase 2 enzyme inducers, which function as indirect antioxidants by activating cellular defense mechanisms rather than directly scavenging free radicals. Sulforaphane’s chemical structure contains an electrophilic isothiocyanate group that allows it to modify specific cysteine residues on regulatory proteins, primarily Keap1, which in turn leads to the activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway. Historically, compounds in this class have been used extensively in chemoprevention research and have been explored for their anti-inflammatory, anticarcinogenic, and neuroprotective properties across various disease models (Zhang et al., 2024; Chang et al., 2020). Their use in preclinical studies has extended to models of oxidative stress in both systemic and ocular tissues, setting the stage for repurposing sulforaphane for diseases in which oxidative damage is central to pathogenesis.

Therapeutic History:
Sulforaphane has a well-established history as a dietary phytochemical known for its robust induction of antioxidant enzymes via activation of Nrf2. Its safety profile is excellent due to its natural dietary origin, and it has been evaluated in numerous preclinical studies as well as in several clinical trials for various cancers and systemic inflammatory conditions – though not directly for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) to date (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In experimental ocular studies, sulforaphane has been shown to protect the retina against light-induced damage and ischemia-reperfusion injury by upregulating cytoprotective genes in retinal cells, including the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), which is critically involved in the pathogenesis of dry AMD (Unknown Reference; Chang et al., 2020). Although clinical trial evidence supporting its efficacy specifically in dry AMD is absent, numerous in vitro and animal studies have demonstrated its potential to alleviate oxidative stress and inflammatory injury in RPE cells – a finding that is particularly relevant given the central role of RPE dysfunction in dry AMD (Bergandi et al., 2024; Sim et al., 2021). Prior work in non-ocular tissues as well as preclinical ocular models suggests that sulforaphane’s repurposing for dry AMD is scientifically plausible, particularly through its capacity to trigger endogenous antioxidant defenses and support cellular clearance mechanisms.

Mechanism of Action:
The key mechanism of action for sulforaphane lies in its ability to activate the Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2) signaling pathway. Under basal conditions, Nrf2 is sequestered in the cytoplasm through its interaction with Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), which facilitates its ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Sulforaphane, via its electrophilic isothiocyanate group, covalently modifies reactive cysteine residues on Keap1. This modification disrupts the Keap1–Nrf2 complex and prevents the degradation of Nrf2, thereby allowing it to accumulate in the cytoplasm and translocate into the nucleus (Chang et al., 2020; Kubo et al., 2017). Once in the nucleus, Nrf2 heterodimerizes with small Maf proteins and binds to the antioxidant response elements (ARE) in the promoter regions of a broad number of cytoprotective genes. This binding leads to the transcriptional induction of various phase II detoxification enzymes and antioxidant genes, including heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1), glutathione S-transferases, and others that contribute to reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and restoring redox homeostasis within cells.

In RPE cells, the induction of these genes is particularly critical because these cells encounter high levels of oxidative stress generated by light exposure, high metabolic activity, and phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments. The activation of Nrf2 by sulforaphane not only enhances the antioxidant capacity of the RPE cells but may also promote autophagy. Preclinical studies have suggested that increased Nrf2 activity can stimulate autophagic mechanisms, improving the clearance of damaged proteins and organelles – a key process to mitigate lipofuscin accumulation and enhance phagosome–lysosome fusion. Lipofuscin is a byproduct of inefficient degradation of photoreceptor outer segments and accumulates in RPE cells with age, contributing to the pathogenesis of dry AMD (Unknown Reference; Yang et al., 2021). In addition, sulforaphane has been observed to modulate inflammatory pathways, particularly through inhibition of NF-κB signaling, thereby reducing the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, and VEGF in a manner that may further mitigate AMD-associated inflammatory damage (Bergandi et al., 2024; Wang & Tang, 2022). Together, these mechanisms – Nrf2-dependent antioxidant responses, enhancement of autophagy, and suppression of inflammatory mediators – form the biochemical basis by which sulforaphane is hypothesized to exert therapeutic effects in the context of dry AMD.

Expected Effect:
Based on its well-characterized mode of action, sulforaphane is expected to exert a multifaceted protective effect in the RPE cells, which are central to the pathology of dry AMD. The primary expected outcome is the induction of Nrf2-dependent antioxidant enzymes, which will reduce oxidative stress and mitigate the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. This in turn is anticipated to prevent further damage to cellular components, such as proteins, lipids, and mitochondrial DNA, that would otherwise lead to cell dysfunction and degeneration (Chang et al., 2020; Pan et al., 2014).

In parallel, the activation of autophagy is expected to enhance the clearance of damaged and oxidized cellular constituents, including lipofuscin, which is a pigment granule that accumulates as a byproduct of inefficient lysosomal degradation of photoreceptor outer segments in RPE cells (Zhang et al., 2024; Lambros & Plafker, 2016). Enhanced autophagic flux should improve phagosome–lysosome fusion, leading to more effective degradation of cellular debris and maintenance of RPE cell homeostasis, which are crucial for supporting photoreceptor health and visual function.

The anticipated effect is also expected to include a reduction in the secretion of VEGF and other pro-inflammatory mediators, thereby potentially attenuating the local inflammatory environment that exacerbates RPE damage and contributes to the progression of dry AMD (Bergandi et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2021). Moreover, sulforaphane's preservation of mitochondrial function by preventing mitochondrial depolarization and maintaining ATP production is critical since compromised mitochondrial bioenergetics are a hallmark of RPE cell dysfunction in dry AMD (Chang et al., 2020; Unknown Reference). Given that RPE cells express Nrf2 at levels essential for redox regulation and survival, enhancing the Nrf2 pathway in these cells is expected to result in improved cellular resilience and a slower progression of dry AMD pathophysiology (Bergandi et al., 2024; Rowan et al., 2020).

Overall, in an experimental assay measuring RPE cell viability, oxidative stress markers, and lysosomal function, sulforaphane treatment is expected to lead to a significant reduction in oxidative stress-related damage, lower levels of lipofuscin accumulation, and improved clearance of photoreceptor outer segment debris. These changes would collectively contribute to maintaining or even restoring retinal homeostasis, delaying the degenerative processes characteristic of dry AMD (Sim et al., 2021; Unknown Reference).

Overall Evaluation:
In evaluating sulforaphane as a therapeutic candidate for dry age-related macular degeneration, several strengths and weaknesses become apparent.

Strengths:
• Natural Origin and Safety Profile: Sulforaphane is a naturally derived compound with an established safety profile due to its presence in commonly consumed vegetables. Its favorable toxicological and pharmacokinetic profiles have been confirmed in numerous clinical studies evaluating dietary isothiocyanates, lending significant translational appeal (Zhang et al., 2024; Kubo et al., 2017).
• Mechanistic Specificity: Sulforaphane has a well-understood mechanism of action centered on the activation of the Nrf2 pathway through Keap1 modification. This leads to a robust induction of a battery of cytoprotective, antioxidant, and phase II detoxifying enzymes. It also appears to modulate inflammatory signaling and promote autophagy, which are critical processes in rescuing RPE function in the face of age-related oxidative stress (Chang et al., 2020; Unknown Reference).
• Preclinical Evidence: A substantial body of preclinical evidence supports the ability of sulforaphane to reduce oxidative damage in retinal cells and protect against experimental models of retinal injury and degeneration. This includes evidence from both in vitro studies using ARPE-19 cells and in vivo animal models that simulate aspects of dry AMD pathology (Unknown Reference; Sim et al., 2021).
• Blood–Retina Barrier Permeability: Research indicates that sulforaphane exhibits favorable pharmacodynamic properties, including the capacity to cross blood–tissue barriers such as the blood–retina barrier. This enhances its suitability as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for ocular diseases like dry AMD (Zhang et al., 2024; Chang et al., 2020).

Weaknesses and Challenges:
• Lack of Direct Clinical Evidence: Despite promising preclinical data, there are currently no registered clinical trials or direct human studies evaluating sulforaphane for dry AMD. The translational gap from preclinical findings to clinical efficacy remains a crucial hurdle that must be addressed in future studies (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Bergandi et al., 2024).
• Dosing and Formulation Issues: Optimal dosing regimens remain to be defined for ocular applications. Although sulforaphane has been administered safely in various systemic contexts, determining a formulation that achieves therapeutic concentrations within the retina without systemic side effects is critical. This may require innovative drug delivery approaches to overcome challenges posed by low water solubility and rapid metabolism (Zhang et al., 2024; Luján et al., 2022).
• Mechanistic Gaps in Autophagy Induction: While there is promising data suggesting that Nrf2 activation by sulforaphane may stimulate autophagy, direct evidence of enhanced autophagosome–lysosome fusion and improved outer segment clearance in RPE cells remains limited. Additional mechanistic studies utilizing models of lipofuscin accumulation and autophagic flux will be necessary to bolster this component of the hypothesis (Unknown Reference; Yang et al., 2021).
• Reliance on Preclinical Models: Many of the supportive data are derived from cellular models or rodent studies that, while encouraging, may not fully recapitulate the complexities of human dry AMD. Extrapolation of these findings to human disease requires caution, and further validation in higher-order preclinical models is imperative (Bergandi et al., 2024; Pan et al., 2014).

Overall, sulforaphane represents a compelling therapeutic candidate for dry AMD due to its multifaceted mechanism of action – primarily Nrf2-dependent antioxidant activity, potential induction of autophagy, and suppression of pro-inflammatory mediators – all of which are critically implicated in the pathogenesis of dry AMD. Its natural origin, established safety as a dietary component, and supportive preclinical data position it as a strong candidate for repurposing. However, significant challenges remain, including the need for targeted clinical trials, optimization of dosing and formulation for ocular delivery, and further mechanistic validation of its effects on autophagic clearance in RPE cells. In light of these findings, the development team should consider advancing sulforaphane into further preclinical studies that focus on ocular-specific models and begin formulation work to enable subsequent early-phase clinical studies that address these critical translational gaps (Unknown Reference; Chang et al., 2020; Sim et al., 2021).

"Siponimod (Mayzent®, catalog SML0766, Sigma-Aldrich)","Proposal for Siponimod (Mayzent®, catalog SML0766, Sigma-Aldrich)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Siponimod (Mayzent®, catalog SML0766, Sigma-Aldrich) is a synthetic small-molecule drug originally developed as a selective modulator of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptors, specifically targeting the S1P₁ and S1P₅ subtypes. It belongs to the class of S1P receptor modulators, compounds that are structurally designed to interact with the G-protein-coupled S1P receptors which play critical roles in immune cell trafficking, vascular homeostasis, and neuroprotection. The discovery of siponimod arose from efforts to develop compounds with a more selective receptor profile than its predecessor fingolimod (FTY720), emphasizing minimization of off-target effects such as cardiac bradycardia commonly associated with broader S1P receptor activity. Siponimod was synthesized by medicinal chemistry programs at companies such as Novartis and has been approved for the treatment of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS), leveraging its capacity to cross the blood–brain barrier and modulate central nervous system (CNS) S1P receptors (Goodman et al., 2019). The compound’s formulation and dosing have been optimized to ensure reproducible pharmacokinetics, facilitating predictable receptor engagement and safety profiles; indeed, its well-characterized PK profile and tunable dosing are a significant advantage when considering the repurposing of drugs into new therapeutic indications.

Therapeutic History:
Historically, siponimod has been used primarily in the treatment of multiple sclerosis, particularly in forms such as relapsing-remitting MS and secondary progressive MS. Its mechanism as an immunomodulator is underpinned by its ability to sequester lymphocytes in lymphoid tissues through selective agonism and functional antagonism at S1P₁, thereby reducing inflammatory damage within the CNS (Goodman et al., 2019; Park & Im, 2017). Preclinical studies have demonstrated its neuroprotective effects in animal models of MS and experimental glaucoma, where siponimod not only modulated immune cell trafficking but also directly acted on neuronal and glial cells to reduce neurodegeneration (Basavarajappa et al., 2023). In addition, studies in albino rabbits have confirmed its ocular bioavailability and safety after intravitreal injection, with pharmacokinetic profiles showing a favorable half-life and no significant retinal toxicity at tested doses (Alshaikh et al., 2024). Although siponimod’s clinical record to date is overwhelmingly based on its use for MS, there is emerging interest in repurposing it for ocular indications. The rationale for such repurposing comes from its known capacity to cross ocular barriers and modulate S1P receptor signaling pathways, which have been implicated in retinal homeostasis. Currently, there is no direct clinical application of siponimod for dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD); however, the existence of 33 relevant clinical trials in databases addressing siponimod in the context of retinal pigment epithelium dysfunction and AMD-related pathways suggests that the drug’s potential in this arena is being actively explored (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, siponimod acts as a selective agonist for S1P₁ and S1P₅ receptors. When activated, S1P₁ receptors lead to receptor internalization and subsequent inhibition of lymphocyte egress; however, beyond immunomodulation, S1P₁ signaling is crucial for maintaining endothelial integrity and promoting neuronal survival through activation of pro-survival signaling cascades such as Akt and extracellular signal–regulated kinase (Erk1/2) pathways (Goodman et al., 2019; Basavarajappa et al., 2023). S1P₅, while less extensively studied than S1P₁, is expressed on various neural cells and, importantly for repurposing in dry AMD, in retinal cells including the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Biochemical studies have implicated S1P signaling in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics, specifically actin remodeling, which is essential for phagocytosis—a process by which RPE cells clear photoreceptor outer segments (POS). Preclinical evidence in models of retinal disease suggests that S1P receptor modulation, particularly through S1P₅, influences the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and promotes the formation of phagosomes, thereby potentially rescuing phagocytic defects (Terao et al., 2019; Porter et al., 2018). Moreover, studies have noted that selective S1P₅ agonism can rescue phagocytosis in models where key phagocytic pathways are disrupted, such as in MERTK-deficient contexts where the clearance of shed photoreceptor outer segments is impaired—an effect that correlates with the hypothesized mechanism for alleviating dry AMD pathology (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Siponimod’s known ability to cross the blood–brain and potentially blood–retina barriers, along with its systemic safety profile, supports its use for directly modulating receptor activity in ocular tissues, thereby influencing both vascular function and intracellular phagocytic machinery without broadly suppressing the immune system (Yang et al., 2024; Alshaikh et al., 2024).

Expected Effect:
The underlying hypothesis driving the repurposing of siponimod for dry AMD is that selective activation of S1P₅ in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells will enhance their phagocytic activity towards photoreceptor outer segments, thereby clearing debris that accumulates in dry AMD and contributes to retinal degeneration. In healthy retinas, RPE cells perform a continuous and highly regulated process of phagocytosing the distal tips of photoreceptor outer segments, which is crucial for maintaining photoreceptor health and overall retinal homeostasis. Dysfunction in this process is a recognized contributing factor in the pathogenesis of dry AMD, leading to accumulation of metabolic waste, oxidative stress, and ultimately, RPE and photoreceptor cell death (Park & Im, 2017; Simón et al., 2019). Preclinical studies have suggested that S1P signaling, particularly via S1P₅ activation, can promote cytoskeletal rearrangements that are necessary for effective phagocytosis; this is likely driven by reorganization of actin filaments and increased formation of phagocytic cups, critical steps in the engulfment of photoreceptor debris (Terao et al., 2019; Porter et al., 2018). Therefore, when applied to an in vitro assay involving RPE cells, siponimod is expected to increase the clearance rate of photoreceptor outer segments by stimulating S1P₅-mediated reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and enhancing phagosome formation. Supporting this hypothesis, molecular studies have shown that S1P receptor expression, including that of S1P₅, is evident in RPE cells, and modulation of these receptors has been linked to improved cell survival and function (Terao et al., 2017; Simón et al., 2019). Additionally, the existing clinical experience with siponimod in other neurological settings provides evidence that its dosing can be finely tuned to achieve the desired therapeutic index without eliciting broad immunosuppression, a property that is particularly appealing for the treatment of chronic conditions such as dry AMD where long-term therapy is required (Goodman et al., 2019; Li et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
Siponimod presents a promising repurposing opportunity for the treatment of dry age-related macular degeneration through its selective modulation of S1P₁/₅ receptors. Among its strengths is the robust clinical and preclinical safety profile demonstrated in MS and ocular studies. Its ability to cross physiological barriers, including the blood–brain and likely the blood–retina barrier, coupled with predictable pharmacokinetics, enhances its suitability for long-term interventions in chronic conditions such as dry AMD (Alshaikh et al., 2024). The drug’s known mechanism of selectively modulating S1P receptors, with particular emphasis on S1P₅, aligns well with the therapeutic goal of enhancing RPE phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments. This approach addresses a validated pathogenic mechanism in dry AMD—the impaired clearance of extracellular debris—which leads to RPE dysfunction and subsequent photoreceptor degeneration (Park & Im, 2017; Simón et al., 2019). The detailed molecular interactions of siponimod, including receptor internalization and activation of intracellular signaling cascades (Akt, Erk1/2), have been well characterized in CNS and retinal models, suggesting that these same pathways could be leveraged to promote cytoskeletal reorganization in RPE cells (Goodman et al., 2019; Basavarajappa et al., 2023).

On the downside, one potential challenge is the possibility of ocular adverse events, such as macular edema, which have been documented with other S1P receptor modulators and in limited cases with siponimod itself (Li et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2024). It will be essential to establish dosing regimens that maximize the beneficial effects on RPE function while minimizing any risks related to vascular permeability or inflammation in the retina. Furthermore, despite the promising preclinical rationale, direct evidence linking siponimod to enhanced RPE phagocytosis in dry AMD models remains limited. Additional targeted studies, both in vitro with RPE cell assays and in vivo in animal models of dry AMD, are necessary to confirm that S1P₅-mediated signaling can indeed rescue phagocytic defects without triggering unwanted immunosuppressive effects (Terao et al., 2019; Porter et al., 2018). The existing literature provides a strong biochemical and pharmacological rationale for evaluating siponimod in this new setting, yet translational gaps remain that must be addressed before clinical application.

In summary, siponimod’s known ocular bioavailability, well-established clinical safety in MS, and detailed mechanism of S1P receptor modulation combine to present a compelling case for its repurposing as a therapeutic candidate for dry AMD. The drug’s ability to target S1P₅ receptors in RPE cells represents a novel approach toward restoring outer segment clearance and maintaining retinal homeostasis. However, while the data supporting its mechanism in neuroprotection and modulation of cytoskeletal dynamics are promising, further direct studies addressing its impact on RPE phagocytosis and retinal function in AMD-specific models are necessary to fully validate this approach. Overall, siponimod exhibits significant potential as an innovative and mechanistically rational candidate that warrants continued evaluation for the treatment of dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Goodman et al., 2019; Li et al., 2023).

"Recombinant human Gas6 (catalog 886-G6, R&D Systems)","Proposal for Recombinant human Gas6 (catalog 886-G6, R&D Systems)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Recombinant human Gas6 (catalog 886-G6, R&D Systems) is a biologic version of the endogenous growth arrest–specific 6 protein (Gas6), a naturally occurring vitamin K–dependent protein discovered originally as a gene product expressed during growth arrest. This compound is synthesized using recombinant protein production platforms that ensure proper post-translational modification, including γ-carboxylation of its N-terminal Gla domain, which is essential for its biological activity; these modifications are critical to permitting its binding to phosphatidylserine (PS) on target cell membranes and for its high-affinity interaction with TAM (Tyro3, Axl, MerTK) receptor tyrosine kinases (Evans, 2016, pp. 14–18; Law et al., 2018, pp. 3–4). As a protein ligand, recombinant human Gas6 belongs to the class of biologics that are designed to mimic or augment endogenous signaling molecules, and its production employs established mammalian cell expression systems (e.g., HEK293) that can yield properly folded, fully γ-carboxylated protein with activity replicating that of the native ligand (Miao et al., 2024, pp. 21–22). This class of therapeutic compounds has been widely used in preclinical research to elucidate receptor–ligand interactions and downstream signaling pathways, as well as to modulate cellular functions such as efferocytosis, immune regulation, and inflammation; hence, the development platforms for such ligand proteins are well defined and are frequently repurposed for novel applications in areas such as oncology, inflammation, and even degenerative diseases (Bellan et al., 2016, pp. 3–4; Burstyn-Cohen, 2017, pp. 7–8).

Therapeutic History:
In preclinical studies, Gas6 has served as an essential tool to study TAM receptor activation, where its binding to receptors, particularly MerTK on the surface of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, has been shown to promote phagocytosis and cell survival (Albert et al., 2015, pp. 1–2; Inana et al., 2018, pp. 1–2). Although Gas6 has not been trialed in registered clinical studies specifically for dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), it has been extensively evaluated in various in vitro and animal models to understand its role in modulating efferocytosis and inflammatory responses in tissues ranging from immune cells to neural and retinal cells (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Evans, 2016, pp. 9–14). In experimental models of retinal dysfunction, particularly in RPE cell cultures and preclinical animal models such as the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rat, impairment of MerTK signaling has been directly linked to defective clearance of photoreceptor outer segments and consequent retinal degeneration (Inana et al., 2018, pp. 11–12; Müller & Finnemann, 2020, pp. 270–272). Recombinant Gas6 has been used primarily to explore the mechanistic aspects of MerTK activation, whereby its administration restored phagocytic capability in RPE cells with intact MerTK signaling, suggesting that this ligand can rescue phagocytic deficits under experimental conditions (Albert et al., 2015, pp. 10–11; Tasnim, 2020, pp. 20–23). Although its clinical application in dry AMD has yet to be established, the therapeutic principle is built on a strong preclinical foundation that supports further translational investigation (Miao et al., 2024, pp. 21–22; Parinot, 2015, pp. 109–112).

Mechanism of Action:
Biochemically, Gas6 is known for its high degree of specificity as a ligand for the TAM receptor family by virtue of its bifunctional domains: the N-terminal Gla domain, which requires vitamin K–dependent γ-carboxylation, binds to phosphatidylserine expressed on the surface of apoptotic cells or cellular debris; and the C-terminal laminin G and SHBG domains, which mediate interaction with TAM receptors including Axl, Tyro3, and particularly MerTK, albeit with varying affinities (Law et al., 2018, pp. 3–4; Tasnim, 2020, pp. 20–23). Upon binding, Gas6 triggers receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of MerTK; this activation leads to the recruitment and activation of downstream effectors such as PI3K/Akt, Rho GTPases, and cytoskeletal regulators that collectively promote actin-driven engulfment and phagosome formation (Parinot, 2015, pp. 109–112; Yefimova et al., 2021, pp. 17–19). In RPE cells, the activation of MerTK by Gas6 is central to the phagocytic clearance of photoreceptor outer segments, a daily renewal process essential to maintain retinal homeostasis and prevent the accumulation of toxic debris, which would otherwise lead to inflammation, oxidative stress, and subsequent cell death (Inana et al., 2018, p. 15; Law et al., 2015, pp. 7–8). The molecular interactions involve not only direct ligand–receptor binding but also modulation by other accessory molecules such as integrins (for instance, αvβ5 integrin), which work in concert with MerTK to ensure efficient phagocytosis (Albert et al., 2015, p. 12). Additionally, there is evidence that Gas6 engagement may lead to the internalization of the receptor and its subsequent recycling, which is crucial for sustained phagocytic activity within the RPE (Evans, 2016, pp. 9–14). This precise mechanism of action is supported by extensive biochemical studies that delineate the structure–function relationship of Gas6 and its role in MerTK-mediated signaling cascades (Davra et al., 2016, pp. 12–14; Huelse et al., 2020, pp. 4–6).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis for using recombinant Gas6 in dry AMD is predicated on its ability to enhance MerTK receptor activation on RPE cells, thereby restoring or augmenting their phagocytic capacity. In the context of dry AMD, where dysfunctional RPE phagocytosis leads to the accumulation of photoreceptor outer segment debris, impaired clearance results in subretinal deposit formation, chronic inflammation, and ultimately retinal degeneration (Inana et al., 2018, pp. 11–12; Parinot, 2015, pp. 109–112). By supplementing recombinant Gas6, the expected outcome is the reactivation of the MerTK signaling pathways that drive actin-mediated engulfment processes, leading to improved clearance of photoreceptor debris and restoration of the physiological balance in the retinal microenvironment (Miao et al., 2024, pp. 20–21; Tasnim, 2020, pp. 20–23). Since MerTK is robustly expressed in RPE cells and is a known mediator of photoreceptor outer segment clearance, activating this receptor with Gas6 should lead to enhanced downstream signaling via the PI3K/Akt pathway, promoting anti-apoptotic effects and preventing RPE cell death (Evans, 2016, pp. 14–18; Unknown Reference). In experimental assays, one would expect to observe increased phagocytic activity, as evidenced by enhanced internalization of labeled photoreceptor outer segments by RPE cultures, reduction in accumulation of debris, and improvement in markers of cell survival and reduced inflammation (Yefimova et al., 2021, pp. 17–19; Parinot et al., 2024, pp. 2–4). Furthermore, because Gas6 is a natural ligand with a well-defined receptor specificity profile, its application is anticipated to produce selective activation of MerTK with minimal off-target activity on other receptor families, thereby reducing the risk of unintended consequences (Bellan et al., 2016, pp. 3–4; Burstyn-Cohen, 2017, pp. 7–8).

Overall Evaluation:
Recombinant human Gas6 stands out as a promising translational candidate for dry AMD therapy based on several key strengths. The foremost strength is its biological relevance; Gas6 is an endogenous ligand that naturally engages MerTK, a receptor whose function is critical for RPE phagocytosis and retinal homeostasis. This mechanistic clarity is supported by a breadth of biochemical evidence demonstrating that Gas6 binding leads to receptor dimerization, autophosphorylation, and activation of downstream signaling cascades that orchestrate cytoskeletal remodeling and phagosome formation (Parinot, 2015, pp. 109–112; Tasnim, 2020, pp. 20–23). Furthermore, preclinical studies have shown that deficiencies in MerTK signaling lead to retinal degenerative phenotypes, and that restoration of this pathway can rescue phagocytic function (Inana et al., 2018, p. 15; Müller & Finnemann, 2020, pp. 270–272). This provides a strong rationale for employing recombinant Gas6 to correct the underlying phagocytic dysfunction observed in dry AMD.

Another significant advantage lies in the well-established production platforms for recombinant proteins. The production of recombinant human Gas6, as evidenced by catalog 886-G6 from R&D Systems, is based on robust manufacturing protocols that ensure homogeneity, proper folding, and requisite post-translational modifications, such as vitamin K–dependent γ-carboxylation, which are essential for its full biological activity (Miao et al., 2024, pp. 20–21; Law et al., 2018, pp. 3–4). This reduces the risk typically associated with novel chemical entities and enables quicker translational efforts. Additionally, the specificity of Gas6 for TAM receptors, particularly MerTK, minimizes the potential for off-target effects that can be seen with less selective small molecule inhibitors.

Despite these strengths, several challenges and weaknesses must be considered. First, although preclinical studies support the mechanistic rationale for Gas6 in restoring RPE phagocytosis, there is a significant gap in clinical data; currently, no clinical trials have investigated the use of recombinant Gas6 for dry AMD, and thus its safety and efficacy in human subjects remain unproven (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Moreover, as a protein-based therapeutic, recombinant Gas6 may face challenges in terms of stability, formulation, and delivery to the retina. The inherent short half-life of many proteins in vivo and potential immunogenicity issues must be addressed, perhaps through advanced drug delivery systems such as nanoparticle encapsulation or sustained-release formulations—strategies that have been explored in other retinal diseases (Wu et al., 2021, pp. 1–2; Wu et al., 2021, pp. 7–10).

Another potential concern is the complexity of TAM receptor signaling in diverse tissue contexts; while selective activation of MerTK on RPE cells is desirable, Gas6 can also engage Axl and Tyro3 receptors, which may have different and even undesired biological effects if activated in non-target tissues (Burstyn-Cohen, 2017, pp. 7–8; Davra et al., 2016, pp. 12–14). Therefore, achieving adequate local concentrations in the retina without eliciting systemic effects or off-target activation will be critical. In addition, the dosing regimen, route of administration (likely intravitreal injection), and long-term safety profile must be rigorously evaluated in preclinical models before progressing to human trials (Inana et al., 2018, pp. 11–12; Huelse et al., 2020, pp. 4–6).

Overall, the compelling mechanistic basis—namely, that recombinant Gas6 engages MerTK to promote actin-driven engulfment and phagosome formation—supports its potential to restore RPE function in dry AMD by enhancing the clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (Miao et al., 2024, pp. 20–21; Axelrod, 2018, pp. 111–114). The fact that Gas6 is an endogenous molecule with well-understood biology further reinforces its appeal as a therapeutic candidate. However, the translational path will require careful formulation work, extensive preclinical validation including pharmacokinetic and toxicology studies, and ultimately, clinical trials to determine efficacy in patients with dry AMD. In conclusion, while recombinant human Gas6 offers a strong mechanistic rationale and a robust biochemical profile as a promoter of MerTK-mediated phagocytosis in RPE cells, its clinical potential for dry AMD will depend on overcoming formulation and delivery challenges and establishing a favorable safety and efficacy profile through rigorous translational research (Albert et al., 2015, pp. 10–11; Unknown Reference; Parinot et al., 2024, pp. 1–2; Davra et al., 2016, pp. 12–14; Sozzi, 2023, pp. 21–25).

In summary, the comprehensive literature review supports that recombinant human Gas6 possesses significant potential as a novel biologic therapeutic candidate for dry AMD. Its natural origin, well-established structure–function relationship, and ability to specifically activate MerTK-mediated signaling in RPE cells position it as a promising agent to restore defective phagocytosis in the retina. The strengths of this candidate include mechanistic clarity, reliance on endogenous signaling pathways, and the availability of established production platforms. The weaknesses, however, lie in the current lack of clinical data and potential challenges in drug delivery and off-target effects. These factors underscore the need for further preclinical studies addressing pharmacokinetics, formulation optimization, and comprehensive safety evaluation before advancing to clinical trials for dry AMD treatment (Miao et al., 2024, pp. 26–28; Inana et al., 2018, p. 15; Law et al., 2015, pp. 7–8; Savage et al., 2015, pp. 60–65; Sawada et al., 2022, p. A939; Wu et al., 2021, pp. 1–2).

────────────────────────────────────────────
Overview of Therapeutic Candidate

T0901317 is a fully synthetic small‐molecule agonist developed to activate liver X receptors (LXRs). It belongs to the nonsteroidal LXR agonist class and was originally synthesized through medicinal chemistry efforts aimed at modulating nuclear receptor–mediated control of lipid homeostasis (Choudhary et al., 2020). LXRs—specifically LXRα encoded by the NR1H3 gene and LXRβ encoded by the NR1H2 gene—are ligand‐activated transcription factors that regulate genes involved in cholesterol metabolism, fatty acid synthesis, and inflammatory processes. These nuclear receptors function by heterodimerizing with retinoid X receptors (RXRs) and binding to response elements in the promoters of target genes, a mechanism that has been well documented both in hepatic tissues and in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) (Choudhary et al., 2020).

The therapeutic class of LXR agonists has been investigated across several disease states because of their capacity to lower intracellular lipid levels and suppress inflammatory gene expression. T0901317, in particular, has been widely used as an investigative tool in in vitro and in vivo models of dyslipidemia, neurodegeneration, and metabolic dysfunction. Beyond its systemic applications, there is considerable interest in ocular diseases because the RPE is highly dependent on efficient cholesterol efflux for maintaining photoreceptor support and overall retinal homeostasis. In dry AMD, impaired lipid clearance is thought to contribute to the formation of drusen, extracellular deposits that occur beneath the RPE and are associated with progressive cell dysfunction (Choudhary et al., 2020). The synthetic origin, robust oral bioavailability, and extensive pharmacological characterization of T0901317 promote its use as a candidate for repurposing in dry AMD, where the goal is to restore proper lipid handling and reduce inflammation in the RPE.

────────────────────────────────────────────
Therapeutic History

In preclinical research, the utility of T0901317 has been demonstrated in a number of cellular and animal models focused on lipid dysregulation and inflammation. Multiple studies have shown that treatment with T0901317 robustly activates LXR signaling in diverse cell types. In cultured human RPE cells subjected to oxidant injury or lipid overload stress, treatment with T0901317 resulted in increased expression of cholesterol transporters such as ABCA1 and ABCG1, which are essential for mediating cholesterol efflux from the cell (Choudhary et al., 2020). In these models, activation of LXRs by T0901317 not only upregulated transcription of these crucial lipid-handling proteins, it also preserved mitochondrial integrity and reduced intracellular lipid accumulation—a finding directly relevant to the pathogenesis of dry AMD, where lipid deposition and oxidative stress are prominent features (Choudhary et al., 2020).

Animal models have provided further support for the concept that LXR activation is beneficial to retinal health. Studies using mouse models with genetic deletion of LXR isoforms have shown that deficiency, especially of LXRα (NR1H3), leads to accumulation of sub-RPE lipid deposits, increased inflammation, and impaired visual function (Choudhary et al., 2020). In these models, the phenotype closely resembles early dry AMD, with the formation of drusen-like deposits consisting of both native and oxidized lipids along with an inflammatory microenvironment. These findings suggest that pharmacologically activating LXRs with compounds such as T0901317 could correct the deleterious effects of lipid accumulation by stimulating lipid efflux pathways and concurrently dampening inflammatory signals (Choudhary et al., 2020).

Furthermore, although T0901317 has been most widely explored in metabolic and neurodegenerative contexts, such as studies focusing on atherosclerosis and Alzheimer’s disease models, its mechanism—upregulation of cholesterol transport mechanisms—has direct applicability to diseases characterized by dysfunctional lipid metabolism, like dry AMD. Indeed, a recent preclinical investigation in RPE models indicates that treatment with T0901317, as well as other LXR agonists, can rescue mitochondrial function and reduce cellular lipid load that otherwise predisposes the retina to degeneration (Choudhary et al., 2020). Such findings have bolstered interest within the research community, although clinical use for dry AMD and any veterinary retinal condition remains unproven and is presently confined to preclinical studies (Choudhary et al., 2020).

────────────────────────────────────────────
Mechanism of Action

The mechanism of action of T0901317 is rooted in its role as an agonist of the liver X receptors LXRα and LXRβ. At the molecular level, T0901317 enters cells and binds directly to the ligand-binding domain of the LXRs. Upon ligand binding, these receptors form heterodimers with RXRs, and the complexes then translocate to the nucleus where they bind to LXR response elements within the promoters of target genes (Choudhary et al., 2020).

Among the critical genes induced by LXR activation are ABCA1 and ABCG1. ABCA1 and ABCG1 are ATP-binding cassette transporters that facilitate cholesterol efflux by exporting cholesterol and phospholipids from the inner leaflet of cell membranes to extracellular acceptors such as apolipoprotein E and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles (Storti et al., 2019). This action is pivotal in maintaining the cholesterol balance in RPE cells. The dysregulation of cholesterol efflux has been implicated in the formation of drusen, since accumulated cholesterol under the RPE can contribute to extracellular deposit formation and photoreceptor debris that exacerbates disease progression in dry AMD (Choudhary et al., 2020; Storti et al., 2019).

Beyond the regulation of lipid efflux, LXR activation by T0901317 also triggers anti-inflammatory pathways. LXRs can downregulate the expression of genes encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines by a mechanism often referred to as transrepression; this involves interference with the NF-κB signaling cascade that drives the transcription of inflammatory mediators such as IL-6, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) (Choudhary et al., 2020). In the retina, such anti-inflammatory effects could mitigate the chronic low-grade inflammation that is associated with dry AMD.

In addition, T0901317 has been shown to protect mitochondrial function. In RPE cells under oxidative stress conditions (for example, when exposed to oxidants like H₂O₂ or cigarette smoke extract), treatment with T0901317 prevents the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential—a critical indicator of mitochondrial integrity and cellular health (Choudhary et al., 2020; Cunza et al., 2021). Preserving mitochondrial function likely contributes indirectly to maintaining efficient autophagy and phagocytic activity, which are necessary for the clearance of photoreceptor outer segments and cellular debris.

Lastly, T0901317 has been reported to regulate genes involved in lipogenesis, such as fatty acid synthase (FASN) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBF1). Although these pathways typically promote lipid biosynthesis, their balanced regulation is essential in RPE cells, as an appropriate balance between lipid synthesis and efflux helps ensure that lipid levels remain within physiological limits (Choudhary et al., 2020). Through this multifaceted mode of action, T0901317 acts to restore cellular lipid homeostasis while simultaneously reducing pro-inflammatory and oxidative stress signals—a combination that is particularly attractive for the treatment of dry AMD, where these pathological processes converge.

────────────────────────────────────────────
Expected Effect in Dry AMD

Based on its mechanism of action, T0901317 is expected to exert several beneficial effects in an AMD-relevant setting, particularly by targeting the retinal pigment epithelium. The primary anticipated outcomes are as follows:

1. Enhanced Cholesterol Efflux and Lipid Clearance
By upregulating ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression in RPE cells, T0901317 should promote the efflux of excess cholesterol and phospholipids. In dry AMD, inefficient removal of lipids from RPE cells leads to the formation of drusen—hallmark extracellular deposits that contribute to retinal degeneration. Reducing intracellular lipid burden would, therefore, decrease both intracellular overload and subsequent extracellular deposit formation (Choudhary et al., 2020; Storti et al., 2019).

2. Reduction of Lipid Deposition and Drusen Formation
A direct consequence of improved lipid efflux is a reduction in sub-RPE lipid accumulation. Preclinical studies have shown that in mouse models genetically deficient in LXR isoforms, there is marked accumulation of lipids beneath the RPE that closely resembles the pathology observed in early-stage dry AMD (Choudhary et al., 2020). By activating LXRs with T0901317, a normalization of this lipid metabolism is expected to reduce drusen-like deposit formation, thereby preserving the RPE’s structural and functional integrity.

3. Anti-Inflammatory Effects
Dry AMD is characterized not only by lipid dysregulation but also by a chronic inflammatory state within the retina. Through the suppression of NF-κB–dependent inflammatory signaling, T0901317 is expected to reduce the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This, in turn, should lower the recruitment and activation of macrophages and microglia in the subretinal space, leading to a more quiescent retinal microenvironment (Choudhary et al., 2020; Song et al., 2022).

4. Mitochondrial Preservation and Oxidative Stress Reduction
Oxidative stress plays a critical role in the degeneration of RPE cells. T0901317’s protective effect on mitochondria—by maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential even under oxidative challenges—should help prevent the cascade of events leading to cellular senescence and apoptosis. In doing so, this compound is anticipated to sustain the phagocytic and autophagic capacity of RPE cells, further contributing to the clearance of photoreceptor debris (Choudhary et al., 2020; Cunza et al., 2021).

5. Improved Autophagic Flux and Lysosomal Function
Complementary to its other effects, T0901317 is thought to support improved subcellular trafficking. Studies in RPE cells subjected to stress—such as those loaded with vitamin A dimers (A2E)—have revealed that excess cholesterol interferes with the recycling of complement regulatory proteins (e.g., CD59) and impairs lysosomal exocytosis. Treatment with LXR agonists has been shown to reverse these defects, improving organelle trafficking and lysosomal function and thus aiding in the clearance of photoreceptor outer segments and cellular waste products (Tan, 2018).

6. Restoration of RPE Homeostasis and Visual Function
Together, the actions described above are expected to culminate in an overall improvement in RPE cell health. By promoting lipid efflux, reducing inflammation, and preserving mitochondrial and lysosomal functionality, T0901317 should help maintain the integrity of the RPE and support photoreceptor survival. In animal models, such improvements have been associated with better visual function and delayed progression of retinal degeneration (Choudhary et al., 2020).

Thus, in assays using human RPE cell cultures, ex vivo retinal explants, or in vivo animal models of dry AMD, T0901317 is anticipated to upregulate ABCA1/ABCG1, reduce lipid deposition (leading to fewer drusen-like deposits), lower inflammatory cytokine expression, and enhance mitochondrial and lysosomal integrity. These interrelated effects provide a comprehensive therapeutic rationale for this compound’s use in ameliorating the pathological mechanisms underlying dry AMD.

────────────────────────────────────────────
Overall Evaluation

Taking into account T0901317’s synthetic origins, its well-documented mechanism of action, and the substantial body of preclinical evidence, the candidate emerges as a promising drug for repurposing in the context of dry AMD. Several key strengths and weaknesses must be considered, as outlined below.

Strengths:

• Mechanistic Precision and Multifaceted Action
T0901317’s ability to induce the transcription of critical genes such as ABCA1 and ABCG1 directly addresses the lipid dysregulation typical of dry AMD (Choudhary et al., 2020; Storti et al., 2019). This action, combined with its anti-inflammatory effects via inhibition of NF-κB signaling (Choudhary et al., 2020), targets two of the most important pathogenic pathways implicated in dry AMD. Such dual activity—improving cholesterol efflux and reducing inflammation—provides a strong mechanistic rationale for its use.

• Mitochondrial and Lysosomal Protection
The compound’s demonstrated ability to protect mitochondrial membrane potential and, by extension, reduce oxidative stress is another key asset. Preservation of mitochondrial function is essential for sustaining RPE phagocytosis and autophagic clearance of photoreceptor debris, processes that are disrupted in dry AMD (Choudhary et al., 2020; Cunza et al., 2021). Furthermore, improvements in lysosomal trafficking and function—linked to reduced cholesterol-induced inhibition of receptor recycling—offer additional support for its potential use in this disease (Tan, 2018).

• Preclinical Evidence in AMD-Relevant Models
Animal models in which LXR function is compromised have consistently shown dry AMD-like phenotypes, including extracellular lipid deposition and RPE degeneration (Choudhary et al., 2020). The reversal of these features upon treatment with LXR agonists in preclinical studies provides further support that activation of LXRs by T0901317 may yield significant therapeutic benefits.

• Oral Bioavailability and Established Use in Experimental Models
T0901317’s oral bioavailability facilitates systemic administration, and its extensive use as a tool compound in experimental studies means that its pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics are well characterized in preclinical settings (Choudhary et al., 2020). This background supports its feasibility for repurposing, provided that future studies can tailor dosing to mitigate off-target effects.

Weaknesses:

• Off-Target Receptor Activation and Pleiotropic Effects
A significant concern with T0901317 is its lack of absolute receptor specificity. Beyond activating LXRs, it also exhibits agonistic activity toward other nuclear receptors, such as the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR) (Choudhary et al., 2020). Such off-target actions can lead to side effects—including transient hypertriglyceridemia and potential hepatic steatosis—that may complicate its therapeutic window. This pleiotropy invites the possibility that systematic exposure might lead to adverse effects not solely confined to the eye.

• Limited Clinical Data in Ocular Indications
While extensive preclinical data support the utility of LXR agonists in models of metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders, direct clinical evidence for the efficacy of T0901317 in dry AMD is still lacking (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). A clinical trials search for T0901317 and related compounds in the context of dry AMD or RPE dysfunction has so far yielded studies largely focused on oncology and systemic conditions. This gap underscores a need for targeted in vivo retinal studies and early-phase clinical trials in AMD patients.

• Potential for Systemic Side Effects
Given that T0901317 is administered orally and affects systemic lipid metabolism, there is a concern that unintentional activation of LXR pathways in non-ocular tissues could lead to adverse outcomes. Strategies to optimize delivery to the retina—such as local administration via intravitreal injections or implantable devices—may be necessary to harness its benefits while curtailing systemic exposure.

• Complexity of Retina Pathophysiology
The etiology of dry AMD is multifactorial, involving not only lipid accumulation and inflammation but also genetic predispositions, complement dysregulation, and oxidative stress. While T0901317 targets several of these pathways, the retina’s intricate regulatory networks might also engage compensatory mechanisms that could reduce the compound’s long-term efficacy. Extensive and prolonged studies will be required to determine whether the beneficial effects observed in short-term preclinical experiments can be sustained.

• Need for Further Selectivity Optimization
Considering the off-target activities, there is an opportunity to develop more selective LXR agonists that retain the beneficial effects on cholesterol efflux and inflammation with a lower risk of interacting with other nuclear receptors. Such optimization would involve structure–activity relationship (SAR) studies to refine T0901317 or its analogs for improved specificity toward RPE cells.

────────────────────────────────────────────
Overall Assessment and Future Directions

Based on the preclinical and molecular evidence available from the cited literature—itself documenting key aspects of LXR function in the retina (Choudhary et al., 2020; Cunza et al., 2021; Song et al., 2022; Storti et al., 2019; Tan, 2018)—T0901317 represents a promising candidate to repurpose for dry AMD treatment. Its ability to upregulate crucial cholesterol transporters that mediate efflux, reduce inflammatory signaling, and preserve mitochondrial and lysosomal function aligns well with the multifaceted pathological changes observed in AMD. The reported improvements in RPE cell health and retinal function in LXR-deficient animal models further validate the rationale behind this therapeutic strategy.

Nonetheless, several challenges remain before T0901317 can be advanced as a therapy for dry AMD. Refinement is required to better control for potential off-target effects mediated by activation of FXR and PXR. Additionally, dedicated retinal delivery methods might be explored to enhance therapeutic efficacy while limiting systemic exposure. The absence of direct clinical trial data in dry AMD also suggests that further preclinical work—focusing on both dose optimization and long-term safety in AMD-relevant animal models—is needed. Finally, given that the pathophysiology of dry AMD involves multiple interacting cellular processes, combinatorial or adjunctive therapies may eventually be required to achieve significant disease modification.

In conclusion, T0901317 shows robust promise as a repurposed agent for treating dry AMD. Its well-characterized pharmacological profile, targeting of LXR-mediated pathways that govern cholesterol efflux and anti-inflammatory signaling, and the preclinical evidence of its efficacy in reducing lipid deposition and preserving RPE functionality collectively support further investigation. Researchers should now pursue additional in vivo studies that focus specifically on the ocular environment, followed by early-phase clinical trials that assess both the efficacy and potential adverse effects when administered either systemically or via targeted ocular delivery routes. With careful dose optimization and further selectivity enhancements, T0901317 or next-generation LXR agonists may ultimately prove to be valuable additions to the therapeutic arsenal against dry AMD (Choudhary et al., 2020; Song et al., 2022; Storti et al., 2019).

────────────────────────────────────────────
Final Remarks

The repurposing potential of T0901317 for dry AMD is underpinned by a detailed understanding of the molecular interactions governing lipid metabolism in the RPE. By enhancing cholesterol efflux, mitigating inflammation, and protecting against oxidative damage, T0901317 targets the core pathogenic processes contributing to dry AMD. Although further research is essential to address issues of receptor specificity and systemic exposure, the existing body of evidence provides a compelling rationale to continue its evaluation. With additional refinements and dedicated retinal studies, T0901317 or similar compounds may ultimately represent a breakthrough in the management of dry AMD, a condition for which current treatment options remain limited.

This extensive literature review, supported by data across multiple biomedical, clinical, and biochemical studies, reinforces the potential of T0901317 as a repurposed drug candidate for dry AMD. Future research should focus on deep preclinical in vivo characterization and the development of targeted delivery systems, thereby laying the groundwork for eventual clinical translation.

"Sitagliptin (Januvia®, catalog S4023, Sigma-Aldrich)","Proposal for Sitagliptin (Januvia®, catalog S4023, Sigma-Aldrich)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Sitagliptin (Januvia®, catalog S4023, Sigma-Aldrich) is a small‐molecule, orally active dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 (DPP-4) inhibitor originally synthesized for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. It was discovered through a rational drug design approach aimed at stabilizing the active incretin hormones, particularly glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), by preventing their enzymatic degradation. Sitagliptin belongs to the class of DPP-4 inhibitors, a group of therapeutics that prolongs the half-life of endogenous incretins, thereby enhancing insulin secretion and suppressing glucagon release. In clinical practice, this class of compounds is primarily used for glycemic control; however, their favorable safety profile and broad tissue distribution have spurred interest in repurposing them for conditions beyond diabetes (Gonçalves, 2016; Simó & Hernández, 2024).

Therapeutic History:
Sitagliptin’s established clinical use in type 2 diabetic patients is well documented, with extensive biochemical and clinical studies confirming its efficacy and safety as a glycemic control agent. Beyond its role in the pancreatic islets, several preclinical and early clinical studies have explored the extrapancreatic benefits of DPP-4 inhibitors, particularly in the retina. In diabetic retinopathy models, sitagliptin has been shown to preserve retinal neuronal function, reduce inflammatory markers, and maintain blood–retinal barrier integrity, all of which are key pathological features in a spectrum of retinal diseases. Notably, clinical and preclinical studies have evaluated the effects of DPP-4 inhibitors on retinal endothelial cells, retinal neuroprotection, and vasculature stabilization (Gonçalves, 2016; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2013). While sitagliptin itself has not been directly trialed in patients with dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the mechanistic overlap between diabetic retinopathy and dry AMD—in particular, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) dysfunction, oxidative stress, and inflammation—suggests a strong translational rationale for its repurposing (Gonçalves, 2016; Li et al., 2025).

Mechanism of Action:
The primary mode of action of sitagliptin is the inhibition of DPP-4, an enzyme that rapidly degrades incretin hormones such as GLP-1. By blocking DPP-4, sitagliptin prolongs the active state of GLP-1, leading to enhanced stimulation of the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) present in multiple tissues, including the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Activation of the GLP-1R is known to engage several intracellular signaling cascades, prominently the cyclic AMP (cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway, which promotes cellular survival, exerts anti-inflammatory effects, and enhances cellular functional processes such as phagocytosis. In the context of dry AMD, a key pathological hallmark is the decline of RPE-mediated phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments—a process that is vital for retinal homeostasis. The hypothesis is that by prolonging endogenous GLP-1 levels, sitagliptin indirectly stimulates GLP-1R on RPE cells, thereby upregulating cAMP/PKA signaling. This signaling cascade is proposed to enhance the expression and activity of molecules such as MER tyrosine kinase (MERTK) and integrins, both of which are critical for the integrin-dependent phagocytic clearance of shed photoreceptor outer segments. Although direct evidence on MERTK/integrin-mediated phagocytosis modulation by sitagliptin specifically in RPE cells is still emerging, the established pharmacology of GLP-1R activation supports improved phagocytic function in several cellular models (Gonçalves, 2016; Puddu & Maggi, 2022). Moreover, ocular penetration studies in experimental models have documented that sitagliptin can reach retinal compartments, thereby providing the necessary drug bioavailability at the site of action (Simó & Hernández, 2024; Ramos et al., 2024).

Expected Effect:
In the context of the proposed application for dry AMD, the expected effect of sitagliptin is to enhance RPE function and improve the phagocytic clearance of photoreceptor outer segments. Specifically, by raising endogenous levels of GLP-1 via DPP-4 inhibition, sitagliptin is anticipated to activate GLP-1R on RPE cells, leading to the stimulation of the cAMP/PKA signaling cascade. This intracellular signaling is pivotal in upregulating molecules such as MERTK and integrins that mediate the phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments—a critical process that is compromised in dry AMD. Furthermore, GLP-1R activation is linked to anti-inflammatory and antioxidative pathways, which could help mitigate the chronic oxidative stress and inflammatory milieu characteristic of dry AMD. The RPE has been shown to express GLP-1 receptors (as evidenced by immunohistochemical studies referenced in related diabetic retinopathy research) and is responsible for the daily turnover of photoreceptor outer segments; maintenance of this function is essential to retinal health (Gonçalves, 2016; Puddu & Maggi, 2022). Thus, the assay proposed—to measure changes in phagocytosis, expression of MERTK, integrin levels, and related signaling molecules in RPE cells—should demonstrate that sitagliptin treatment leads to enhanced phagocytic activity, reduced inflammatory cytokine production, and improved cellular survival markers. The expected overall outcome is a restoration of RPE function, decreased accumulation of debris in the subretinal space, and mitigation of the degenerative processes that underlie dry AMD progression (Leote, 2023; Gonçalves, 2016).

Overall Evaluation:
Sitagliptin presents several compelling strengths as a therapeutic candidate for dry AMD. First, its established safety profile in diabetic patients, combined with decades of clinical use and regulatory approval, makes it an attractive candidate for repurposing with a lower barrier to clinical translation (Gonçalves, 2016; Li et al., 2025). Second, the mechanism of enhancing endogenous GLP-1 levels to subsequently stimulate GLP-1R-mediated cAMP/PKA signaling offers a mechanistically specific approach that directly targets a known deficiency in dry AMD: the impaired phagocytic activity of RPE cells. The hypothesis that upregulation of MERTK and integrin-dependent pathways can restore phagocytic function is underpinned by extensive biochemical data in diabetic retinopathy models where similar pathways are implicated (Gonçalves, 2016; Puddu & Maggi, 2022). Third, there is preclinical evidence from diabetic retinopathy studies demonstrating that DPP-4 inhibitors like sitagliptin confer neuroprotective and vascular-stabilizing benefits in retinal tissues independent of systemic glycemic control, suggesting that similar mechanisms might protect against the neurodegenerative and inflammatory elements of dry AMD (Gonçalves, 2016; Ramos et al., 2022).

Nevertheless, several challenges and weaknesses must be considered. One potential issue is the extent and consistency of ocular penetration by sitagliptin. Although some studies have documented its ability to reach retinal compartments following topical administration, definitive pharmacokinetic studies in human ocular tissues are limited. This raises questions about whether therapeutically effective concentrations can be reliably achieved in the RPE (Simó & Hernández, 2024; Ramos et al., 2024). In addition, while diabetic retinopathy models provide a useful proxy, they differ in key aspects from the pathogenesis of dry AMD. Diabetic retinopathy involves significant vascular leakage and inflammation, whereas dry AMD is characterized predominantly by RPE degeneration, drusen accumulation, and geographic atrophy. Although there is some mechanistic overlap, the specific microenvironment and progression of dry AMD may require tailored dosing and delivery strategies (Gonçalves, 2016; Li et al., 2025). Furthermore, certain data in the literature suggest that DPP-4 inhibitors can have adverse effects on retinal endothelial cells in some experimental settings—such as an increase in vascular leakage via the SDF-1α/CXCR4/Src/VE-cadherin pathway—which could pose risks if similar mechanisms occur in human ocular tissues (Lee et al., 2016; Jäckle et al., 2020). However, it is important to note that the pathophysiological context in dry AMD is different from that in diabetic retinopathy, and the vascular concerns may be less pertinent in a non-neovascular, atrophic disease setting.

Another consideration is the translational gap between preclinical models and human disease. While the mechanistic rationale is robust, direct clinical evidence supporting the use of sitagliptin in dry AMD is currently lacking. Most available studies involve diabetic retinopathy models, and while these models share certain aspects of RPE dysfunction and inflammation with dry AMD, the disease etiologies are not identical. Additional comprehensive preclinical studies using dry AMD-specific models and subsequent phase I/II clinical trials will be necessary to validate the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin when repurposed for this indication (Gonçalves, 2016; Li et al., 2025).

On the mechanistic front, while the hypothesis posits that GLP-1 elevation and subsequent cAMP/PKA signal activation leads to upregulation of phagocytic machinery in RPE cells, the direct evidence for upregulation of MERTK and integrin-dependent phagocytosis by sitagliptin remains somewhat indirect. Most supporting data come from studies in diabetic retinopathy models and in vitro experiments that assess the protective and anti-inflammatory effects of incretin-based therapies (Puddu & Maggi, 2022; Gonçalves, 2016). Detailed biochemical studies specifically focused on RPE phagocytic function, including measurement of MERTK expression and integrin activation after sitagliptin treatment, would further strengthen the case for repurposing this agent for dry AMD.

In summary, sitagliptin shows promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry AMD due to its well-characterized mechanism as a DPP-4 inhibitor, its potential to enhance GLP-1-mediated neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory signaling in RPE cells, and its documented safety in diabetic populations. Its strengths lie in the mechanistic specificity of incretin signaling modulation and favorable systemic safety, while its weaknesses are primarily linked to uncertainties regarding ocular pharmacokinetics, disease-specific translational efficacy, and potential adverse vascular effects observed in some models. Overall, further targeted preclinical studies focusing on dry AMD-specific pathology and subsequent early-phase clinical trials will be critical to validate the therapeutic potential of sitagliptin in this context (Gonçalves, 2016; Simó & Hernández, 2024; Ramos et al., 2024).

"Recombinant human Protein S (Pros1, catalog 8856-PS, R&D Systems)","Proposal for Recombinant human Protein S (Pros1, catalog 8856-PS, R&D Systems)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Recombinant human Protein S (Pros1, catalog 8856-PS from R&D Systems) is a biologic therapeutic derived from the natural vitamin K–dependent plasma glycoprotein Protein S. In its endogenous form, Protein S is synthesized primarily by hepatocytes and is well known for its anticoagulant functions, but it also plays a crucial role as a ligand for the TAM receptor family—including MerTK and Tyro3—that governs efferocytosis and immune homeostasis. The recombinant version is produced using mammalian expression systems that faithfully recapitulate the essential posttranslational modifications, most notably γ-carboxylation of its Gla domain, which is required for high-affinity binding to phosphatidylserine (PS) exposed on apoptotic membranes. This engineering ensures that recombinant human Protein S retains its natural binding specificity and functional capacity. As a member of the class of protein-based biologics, Protein S has historically been studied primarily in the context of coagulation and immune modulation, and its role in mediating phagocytic clearance in various tissues—including the retina—is now emerging as an attractive target for therapeutic repurposing in conditions such as dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (Parinot et al., 2024; Burstyn-Cohen et al., 2012).

Therapeutic History:
Protein S’s biological functions have been extensively characterized in both coagulation and immune regulation. Historically, Protein S was discovered and evaluated in relation to its anticoagulant properties and its involvement as a cofactor for activated Protein C. Over the past decades, its capacity to act as a ligand for TAM receptors (specifically MerTK and Tyro3) has been elucidated through genetic dissection studies in animal models and cellular assays. Research in the retinal system has demonstrated that Protein S, alongside Gas6, cooperates to regulate MerTK-dependent phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) by retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, a process essential for retinal homeostasis. Deficiencies in TAM receptor signaling, as evidenced by knockout mouse models and conditional gene deletion studies, result in impaired phagocytosis, leading to debris accumulation and subsequent retinal degeneration resembling features seen in dry AMD (Burstyn-Cohen et al., 2012; Parinot et al., 2024). Although recombinant Protein S has not yet been extensively evaluated in clinical trials specifically for the treatment of dry AMD, a comprehensive search of clinical trial databases (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.) reveals a significant level of research interest in related biological pathways. Moreover, the therapeutic paradigm of correcting phagocytic deficits via TAM receptor agonism has been well documented in preclinical models of retinal degeneration—even if the direct use of recombinant Protein S in this context remains to be fully established in the literature (Bushehri et al., 2019; Nashine, 2021).

Mechanism of Action:
The molecular rationale for using recombinant Protein S in dry AMD hinges on its ability to selectively bind phosphatidylserine (PS) on apoptotic cells and debris—in this case, the worn or shed photoreceptor outer segments—and to engage TAM receptor tyrosine kinases, particularly MerTK and Tyro3, on RPE cells. At the biochemical level, Protein S contains an N-terminal Gla domain that undergoes γ-carboxylation in a vitamin K–dependent process; this modification confers high-affinity binding to the negatively charged PS moieties that become exposed during apoptosis or the shedding of POS (Bushehri et al., 2019; Rothlin et al., 2015). Once bound to PS on the debris, Protein S acts as a bridging molecule, engaging the extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains of MerTK on the surface of RPE cells. Structural studies using mutagenesis and ligand-binding assays have shown that Protein S binds primarily to the Ig-like 1 domain of MerTK, unlike Gas6 which interacts with both Ig-like domains. This selective binding is critical, as it triggers MerTK dimerization and autophosphorylation, leading to the downstream activation of intracellular signaling cascades that promote actin cytoskeletal reorganization—a prerequisite for efficient phagocytosis (Parinot et al., 2024; Burstyn-Cohen et al., 2012).

Furthermore, TAM receptor activation via Protein S engagement has important anti-inflammatory consequences. Activation of MerTK leads to the suppression of pro-inflammatory signaling, partly through the engagement of pathways such as interferon‐α receptor/STAT1 and the subsequent upregulation of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins. Thus, Protein S contributes not only to the direct clearance of extracellular debris but also to a protective, anti-inflammatory milieu that is conducive to retinal cell survival. In the context of the retina, where RPE cells are in a constant state of contact with photoreceptors and their shed outer segments, the timely and efficient clearance of such debris is paramount for preserving photoreceptor function and preventing pathological changes such as lipofuscin accumulation—a hallmark of dry AMD (Parinot et al., 2024; Burstyn-Cohen et al., 2012).

A further aspect of the mechanism involves the dynamic regulation of ligand availability over the circadian cycle. Studies have demonstrated that the expression levels of Protein S and Gas6 in the retina vary with the light–dark cycle: Protein S levels peak just before the phagocytic burst of RPE cells, thereby priming MerTK for activation, whereas Gas6 levels tend to increase during the peak phagocytic activity and may modulate or downregulate the process through mechanisms such as increased soluble MerTK release (Parinot et al., 2024). This temporal regulation suggests that the precise timing and stoichiometry of ligand-receptor interactions are critical for maintaining retinal homeostasis. Importantly, genetic models in which both Protein S and Gas6 are absent show retinal degeneration akin to that observed in MerTK-deficient models, underscoring the indispensability of these ligands in retinal phagocytosis (Burstyn-Cohen et al., 2012; Parinot et al., 2024).

Expected Effect:
The proposed mechanism of action leads us to expect that administration of recombinant human Protein S will enhance the phagocytic capacity of RPE cells in dry AMD. In a well-designed assay that utilizes cultured primary RPE cells or established RPE cell lines, recombinant Protein S is anticipated to bind to PS on shed or apoptotic photoreceptor outer segments and thereby engage MerTK on the RPE surface. This engagement would trigger MerTK autophosphorylation and downstream signaling events that recruit actin modulators responsible for the internalization of outer segments. Consequently, this would restore defective or suboptimal phagocytic clearance associated with dry AMD, leading to a reduction in the accumulation of cellular debris (Parinot et al., 2024; Inana et al., 2018).

At the cellular level, one could monitor changes in phagocytosis by fluorescent labeling of photoreceptor outer segments and subsequent imaging or fluorometric quantification of internalized debris. Upregulation of MerTK activation and a concomitant decrease in markers of inflammation—such as pro-inflammatory cytokines or activation of NF-κB pathways—would be additional readouts supporting the efficacy of the treatment. Since RPE cells express high levels of MerTK, mRNA quantification studies from Burstyn-Cohen et al. (2012) reveal a fourfold higher expression compared to Tyro3, the likelihood of a robust response to Protein S treatment is high. The expected outcome is not only enhanced debris clearance but also a restoration of RPE cell homeostasis, thereby potentially arresting or reversing the degenerative process observed in dry AMD (Nashine, 2021; Inana et al., 2018).

Furthermore, genetic studies have demonstrated that partial restoration of either Gas6 or Protein S is sufficient to maintain photoreceptor survival in murine models, indicating that even partial correction of the phagocytic deficit might yield clinically significant improvements. This expected effect is supported by data showing that the addition of Protein S to TAM-deficient models rescues phagocytosis and reduces the progression of retinal degeneration, emphasizing its potential as a biologic therapeutic for dry AMD (Burstyn-Cohen et al., 2012; Parinot et al., 2024).

Overall Evaluation:
Recombinant human Protein S presents as a promising drug candidate for the treatment of dry AMD primarily due to its well-defined role as a TAM receptor ligand that modulates phagocytosis and anti-inflammatory signaling in the retina. One of the major strengths of this approach is the robust genetic evidence linking deficient TAM signaling with impaired RPE phagocytosis and subsequent photoreceptor degeneration. Studies have unequivocally demonstrated that the loss of Protein S (or its partner Gas6) in animal models results in retinal degeneration analogous to that seen in MerTK knockouts (Parinot et al., 2024; Burstyn-Cohen et al., 2012). This provides a solid biological rationale for the use of exogenous recombinant Protein S to restore phagocytic activity in RPE cells. Additionally, the biochemical specificity of Protein S for phosphatidylserine—an “eat-me” signal on apoptotic debris—ensures that its activity is targeted to the correct substrate, thereby reducing the risk of off-target effects. The manufacturing processes for recombinant proteins such as Protein S are well established, and the ability to produce biologically active, properly modified protein ensures that the candidate can be readily scaled for further preclinical and clinical evaluation (Bushehri et al., 2019; Rothlin et al., 2015).

In terms of weaknesses, the primary challenge remains the absence of direct clinical or extensive preclinical data evaluating recombinant Protein S in models of dry AMD. While genetic and in vitro studies provide strong mechanistic support, translational confirmation in appropriate animal models and ultimately human subjects is essential. There is also a potential concern regarding the complexity of the TAM receptor signaling pathway, as the interplay between Protein S and Gas6 may implicate context-dependent effects that are not completely understood; for example, Gas6 has been reported to have inhibitory effects under certain conditions, and the balance between these ligands may be critical for optimal therapeutic outcomes (Parinot et al., 2024; Burstyn-Cohen et al., 2012). Moreover, although recombinant Protein S is known to bind phosphatidylserine and activate MerTK, the precise dose-response relationship and potential immunogenicity in the ocular environment require further elucidation. It is also noteworthy that, unlike traditional small-molecule drugs, biologics such as recombinant proteins may face additional challenges in terms of delivery to the retina—strategies such as intravitreal injections or specialized drug delivery systems must therefore be carefully optimized (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Despite these challenges, the overall evaluation of recombinant human Protein S as a therapeutic candidate for dry AMD is positive. The candidate is underpinned by a strong mechanistic framework that involves the restoration of MerTK-dependent phagocytosis in RPE cells, a pathway with direct implications for the pathophysiology of dry AMD. The robust preclinical studies demonstrating that deficiency in TAM ligands results in retinal degeneration further support the potential efficacy of this approach (Parinot et al., 2024; Burstyn-Cohen et al., 2012). Provided that issues related to dosing, delivery, and long-term safety can be addressed through rigorous preclinical and, eventually, clinical testing, recombinant Protein S has significant promise as a novel biologic therapeutic for dry AMD. Its ability to target a fundamental cellular process—namely, the clearance of apoptotic debris via TAM receptor activation—positions it advantageously relative to current treatments that mainly target angiogenesis and inflammation in neovascular AMD, leaving the dry form of the disease largely unmet (Nashine, 2021; Inana et al., 2018).

In summary, recombinant human Protein S represents a mechanistically sound and biochemically validated therapeutic candidate for dry AMD. Its natural role as a bridging molecule in the clearance of photoreceptor debris, combined with its capacity to activate anti-inflammatory and phagocytic signaling via MerTK, provides a compelling rationale for its development. While preclinical data remain limited and further studies are warranted to optimize delivery and dosing, the strengths of this candidate—supported by extensive genetic and molecular evidence—make it a promising candidate for repurposing in dry AMD treatment (Parinot et al., 2024; Burstyn-Cohen et al., 2012; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

•","Proposal for Roflumilast (Daliresp®, catalog R6520, Sigma-Aldrich)

Below is the comprehensive evaluation of the proposal regarding repurposing Roflumilast (Daliresp®, catalog R6520, Sigma-Aldrich) for use in dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

• Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Roflumilast is a selective phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitor that was originally developed and approved for the treatment of inflammatory respiratory conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Its synthesis and development reflect standard synthetic medicinal chemistry techniques aimed at producing small molecules capable of modulation of cyclic nucleotide metabolism; in this case, by selectively inhibiting the PDE4 isoform, which hydrolyzes cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in various cell types. It belongs to a class of therapeutics with known anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. Drugs in this class have primarily been used in systemic inflammatory conditions—especially in the respiratory system—and, more recently, repurposing strategies are being investigated for applications in other tissues affected by chronic inflammation and degeneration. In our context, the interest in Roflumilast is driven by the possibility that, because PDE4 is expressed in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and other retinal cells, selective PDE4 inhibition can elevate intracellular cAMP, thereby triggering protein kinase A (PKA)‐mediated phosphorylation cascades that could modulate actin dynamics and cytoskeletal regulators essential for phagocytosis. This proposed mechanism is aligned with the idea of improving clearance of photoreceptor debris—which is a hallmark of dry AMD—through increased RPE phagocytic capacity. The extensive preclinical work using related agents such as rolipram (another PDE4 inhibitor) has been instrumental in establishing a safety and mechanistic profile that supports Roflumilast’s development for non-respiratory indications (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Luu, 2024).

• Therapeutic History:
Roflumilast is well-established clinically as an anti-inflammatory agent in respiratory disease, where its ability to suppress inflammatory cytokine production and immune cell activation has been confirmed in multiple Phase I–III clinical trials. In addition to its approved respiratory indications, other PDE4 inhibitors such as rolipram have been studied in a variety of contexts—including depressive disorders—and have demonstrated acceptable safety profiles at doses that elevate cAMP while mitigating inflammatory responses (Harding, 2024; Luu, 2024). However, despite extensive clinical use in non-ocular settings, a focused search of registered clinical trials addressing its use in macular degeneration, retinal diseases, or RPE-based pathologies has yielded no direct studies (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Consequently, while PDE4 inhibitors have been investigated across several disease models, there is a noted absence of clinical evidence specifically addressing their safety and efficacy in ocular diseases such as dry AMD. Preclinical studies using related compounds in animal models of retinal stress and degeneration have provided proof-of-concept that modulating the cAMP/PKA pathway via PDE4 inhibition can preserve retinal structure and function (Luu, 2024).

• Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, Roflumilast and its class members act by selectively inhibiting PDE4, an enzyme responsible for hydrolyzing intracellular cAMP. The inhibition of PDE4 results in elevated cAMP levels, which in turn activates PKA. The activation of PKA phosphorylates downstream substrates, including cytoskeletal regulators and other proteins involved in phagocytosis. In particular, RPE cells require dynamic actin remodeling to efficiently engulf and clear photoreceptor outer segment debris. The increased PKA activity may lead to phosphorylation of key targets such as cofilin and other actin-binding proteins, thereby enhancing phagocytic machinery activity. Moreover, several preclinical studies indicate that PDE4 inhibition leads to reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and apoptotic markers (e.g., TNFR1 and Fas), while simultaneously upregulating genes involved in cellular homeostasis and somatic maintenance (e.g., Glul, RdCVF) (Luu, 2024). Importantly, single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic analyses in murine models reveal that alterations in cyclic nucleotide signaling are associated with improved RPE function and retinal preservation, indirectly supporting a role for enhanced phagocytosis and clearance of photoreceptor debris (Luu, 2024). In macrophage models, for instance, increased cAMP levels have been shown to promote efferocytosis, and given the similar cellular machinery in RPE cells, it is reasonable to hypothesize that a comparable mechanism will be active here (Harding, 2024).

• Expected Effect:
The proposed hypothesis is that Roflumilast will act on RPE cells by increasing intracellular cAMP, leading to the activation of PKA‐mediated phosphorylation events that enhance actin remodeling. These events are essential for the phagocytosis and efficient clearance of photoreceptor debris—a process that is typically impaired in dry AMD. Based on the preclinical data from systems pharmacology investigations, selective PDE4 inhibition has been associated with the upregulation of homeostatic and neuroprotective pathways while suppressing stress-induced inflammatory cascades. In dry AMD, the accumulation of extracellular debris (drusen) and insufficient clearance by RPE cells contribute to disease progression through chronic inflammation and photoreceptor loss. Thus, by restoring RPE phagocytosis and enhancing cytoskeletal dynamics, Roflumilast is expected to reduce debris accumulation, improve retinal cell viability and structural integrity, and ultimately slow disease progression (Luu, 2024). In addition, the oral bioavailability and well-characterized pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile of Roflumilast, already established through its approved use in COPD, provide confidence in its translational feasibility to ocular contexts, even though direct ocular formulations (e.g., sustained-release intravitreal injections) may need to be explored to optimize local safety and efficacy (Luu, 2024).

• Overall Evaluation:
Overall, repurposing Roflumilast for dry AMD presents a compelling therapeutic opportunity based on sound mechanistic rationale, extensive safety data in other indications, and a convergence of evidence from systems pharmacology approaches that support PDE4 inhibition as a stress resilience-enhancing strategy. One of the principal strengths of this candidate is its well-characterized mechanism: the selective inhibition of PDE4 leading to increased intracellular cAMP and subsequent activation of PKA, which is critical for actin remodeling and successful phagocytosis by RPE cells. This mechanism is supported by multiple layers of evidence—from biochemical assays demonstrating changes in cAMP/PKA signaling to preclinical models that show improved retinal structure and function following PDE inhibition (Luu, 2024). Additionally, the long clinical history and established pharmacokinetic profile of Roflumilast in respiratory disease add a significant degree of translational feasibility and safety assurance, which are key for repurposed drugs in new indications (Harding, 2024; Luu, 2024).

On the other hand, a primary weakness is the current lack of direct clinical or preclinical data specifically demonstrating ocular efficacy. Although the mechanism is highly plausible and there is supportive evidence from analogous studies using rolipram as a representative PDE4 inhibitor, Roflumilast itself has not been evaluated directly in models of dry AMD or in studies assessing RPE phagocytosis of photoreceptor debris (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Luu, 2024). This gap necessitates further dedicated studies, including detailed in vitro assays in RPE cell lines and in vivo evaluations in appropriate animal models, to confirm not only that Roflumilast can modulate the cAMP/PKA pathway in ocular tissues but also that such modulation translates into meaningful structural and functional improvements in the retina.

Another consideration is the potential for systemic side effects given the oral administration of Roflumilast. While the safety profile in COPD patients is well established, ocular tissues have unique pharmacodynamic properties, and long-term systemic exposure might not fully capture the nuances of local retinal effects. Therefore, exploration of alternative delivery routes that maximize ocular tissue concentrations while minimizing systemic exposure—such as a sustained-release intravitreal formulation—may be necessary to safely and effectively repurpose this drug for dry AMD (Luu, 2024).

In conclusion, the mechanistic specificity provided by targeting PDE4 is highly attractive given its known role in regulating cAMP levels and promoting anti-inflammatory, cytoprotective, and phagocytic responses in cells. Roflumilast offers several advantages thanks to its established clinical history, well-understood pharmacology, and the converging preclinical evidence suggesting that enhancing RPE cell function via cAMP elevation could remediate key pathological features of dry AMD. Nevertheless, before a clinical development plan can be advanced, it is critical to generate robust preclinical data in ocular models to address the current knowledge gap regarding its effects on RPE phagocytosis, photoreceptor debris clearance, and overall retinal homeostasis.

Thus, from our comprehensive literature review drawing on biochemical, clinical, and cellular studies—and supported by numerous insights from systems pharmacology investigations—it is our evaluation that Roflumilast holds promising potential as a repurposed drug candidate for dry AMD. The next steps should focus on rigorous preclinical validation in retinal models and exploration of optimized ocular delivery strategies to fully determine its therapeutic efficacy for this indication (Luu, 2024; Cruz et al., 2020).

"Cilostazol (Pletal®, catalog C1910, Sigma-Aldrich)","Proposal for Cilostazol (Pletal®, catalog C1910, Sigma-Aldrich)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Cilostazol is a synthetic small‐molecule agent originally discovered and developed as a selective phosphodiesterase‐3 (PDE3) inhibitor that elevates intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels by blocking its degradation, thereby modulating diverse signaling pathways in vascular and neural tissues (Morishita, 2005). It belongs to the PDE inhibitor class, a chemically defined group of compounds that have historically been used in cardiovascular therapeutics for their antiplatelet, vasodilatory, and anti‐inflammatory actions, with cilostazol being marketed under the name Pletal® and approved for treating intermittent claudication and certain stroke prevention indications (Tanano et al., 2013). The compound is synthesized through chemical modification of the pyrimido-pyrimidine core structure and has been optimized to yield high selectivity for PDE3 isoforms, particularly those expressed in platelets and vascular smooth muscle cells (Asal & Wojciak, 2017). Owing to its ability to cross tissue barriers and its well‐characterized pharmacokinetic profile from extensive clinical use in peripheral vascular disorders, cilostazol has been proposed for repurposing in ocular diseases, especially dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD), where targeting the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a promising strategy (Yanai & Endo, 2019).

Therapeutic History:
Clinically, cilostazol has a robust history as a cardiovascular therapeutic agent and has been widely used to manage conditions such as intermittent claudication and to provide secondary stroke prevention given its antiplatelet and vasodilatory properties (Morishita, 2005; Trawally, 2023). Its beneficial effects on microcirculation have been documented in diverse vascular beds, including retinal and cerebral vessels, with experimental studies showing prolongation of endothelial barrier integrity and enhanced nitric oxide production, particularly in retinal arterioles (Tanano et al., 2013). Although cilostazol’s clinical use has been predominantly in cardiovascular indications and more recently in some studies addressing diabetic microvascular complications, there is no current clinical trial evidence using cilostazol specifically for dry AMD, as evidenced by a lack of entries in clinical trial databases (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). However, related preclinical research in retinal models, including studies on diabetic animal models, supports its anti‐oxidative and anti‐inflammatory effects in the retina (Yeh et al., 2019), and its documented neuroprotective actions in retinal ischemia models further suggest that its application might extend to conditions like dry AMD where RPE dysfunction and photoreceptor debris accumulation are central (Ishizuka et al., 2013).

Mechanism of Action:
Cilostazol exerts its primary pharmacological action by selectively inhibiting PDE3, which is responsible for the hydrolysis of cAMP in numerous cell types; this enzyme inhibition leads to an elevation in intracellular cAMP levels and subsequent activation of protein kinase A (PKA) (Morishita, 2005). In vascular cells, the increased cAMP activates PKA, which phosphorylates various targets including endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and reconfigures cytoskeletal and tight junction proteins to enhance endothelial barrier function—a mechanism that has been observed in brain microvascular endothelial cells (Liu et al., 2012). In the context of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), the hypothesis is that elevated cAMP through PDE3 inhibition can promote cytoskeletal rearrangements, which are crucial for the process of phagosome maturation and thus for the clearance of photoreceptor outer segment debris (Luu, 2024). Furthermore, cilostazol’s anti‐inflammatory actions are mediated by PKA‐dependent inhibition of key pro‐inflammatory transcription factors such as nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), which reduces the expression of adhesion molecules and inflammatory cytokines in vascular and possibly retinal cells (Coenen et al., 2021). The compound’s ability to modulate microcirculation by promoting vasodilation via nitric oxide production also contributes to improved retinal blood flow and potentially augments RPE cell function under stress conditions—a benefit supported by preclinical findings in retinal ischemia models (Ishizuka et al., 2013; Tanano et al., 2013).

Expected Effect:
The proposed mechanism underlying the therapeutic use of cilostazol in dry AMD is that its PDE3 inhibition will increase intracellular cAMP in RPE cells, leading not only to activation of PKA but also to a cascade of downstream effects that facilitate cytoskeletal reorganization and phagosome maturation. This, in turn, is expected to enhance the RPE’s capacity for phagocytosis—essential for clearing spent photoreceptor outer segment debris—thereby mitigating a key feature of dry AMD pathogenesis (Luu et al., 2023). In addition, the anti-inflammatory and vasodilatory effects of cilostazol are anticipated to reduce chronic low-grade inflammation and improve retinal microcirculation, which are both critical in preventing or slowing the progression of RPE dysfunction and subsequent photoreceptor degeneration common in dry AMD (Trawally, 2023; Yeh et al., 2019). Given that RPE cells express components of the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway, and that phagocytosis in these cells has been linked to proper cytoskeletal function and inflammatory regulation, cilostazol’s targeted action should theoretically enhance RPE survival and functionality (Luu, 2024). This dual mode of action—boosting debris clearance and stabilizing microvascular and inflammatory homeostasis—represents a compelling rationale for its application in dry AMD, even though direct clinical trial confirmation in this indication is currently lacking (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Overall Evaluation:
In summary, the repurposing of cilostazol for dry AMD is supported by an extensive body of preclinical research that highlights its multifaceted pharmacological profile, particularly its selective inhibition of PDE3 which leads to elevated cAMP levels and activation of PKA pathways. This mechanism not only underpins its established uses in improving vascular tone and reducing platelet aggregation but also offers a targeted approach to enhance RPE phagocytic function and reduce retinal inflammation—a combination of effects that are highly desirable in the treatment of dry AMD (Morishita, 2005; Ishizuka et al., 2013). Strengths of this therapeutic candidate include its known safety profile and pharmacokinetics from extensive clinical experience in cardiovascular indications, the mechanistic specificity offered by PDE3 inhibition compared to broader PDE inhibitors, and preclinical evidence of beneficial vascular and neuroprotective effects in retinal models (Tanano et al., 2013; Trawally, 2023). Furthermore, cilostazol’s ability to modulate key signaling pathways implicated in RPE function—such as through cytoskeletal rearrangement and phagosome maturation—aligns strongly with current understanding of the pathophysiology of dry AMD (Luu, 2024; Luu et al., 2023). However, weaknesses of the candidate include the complete absence of dedicated clinical trial data in the setting of dry AMD, potential challenges in achieving effective ocular drug delivery (especially if an oral formulation may not concentrate adequately in the retina), and the need for further targeted preclinical studies to specifically assess its effects on RPE phagocytic capacity and photoreceptor debris clearance in AMD-relevant models (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Yeh et al., 2019). Additionally, while broad anti‐inflammatory and vasodilatory benefits are suggested by the literature, precise correlates of these effects in the context of the intricate retinal microenvironment remain to be defined (Coenen et al., 2021; Luu, 2024).

Overall, cilostazol represents a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry AMD based on its mechanistic properties and established clinical history in other vascular-related indications. Its capacity to enhance cAMP-dependent signaling in RPE cells, coupled with its anti-inflammatory and microcirculatory benefits, provides a strong scientific rationale that merits further investigation through targeted preclinical studies and eventual early-phase clinical trials. The proposal to assess its effect on RPE phagocytosis and debris clearance is well-founded in the current literature describing PDE regulation in retinal cells, although careful attention must be given to the challenges of ocular drug delivery and subset-specific efficacy in the complex milieu of dry AMD (Luu, 2024; Trawally, 2023). In conclusion, while there are some uncertainties that require addressing through rigorous experimental validation, the overall therapeutic profile of cilostazol justifies its further development as a candidate for the treatment of dry AMD, and this line of investigation should be pursued to determine its translational viability in the ocular setting (Yanai & Endo, 2019; Ishizuka et al., 2013).

"PRE-084 (catalog 2697, Tocris)","Proposal for PRE-084 (catalog 2697, Tocris)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
PRE-084 is a synthetic small-molecule agent originally discovered and characterized as a selective sigma-1 receptor (S1R) agonist that belongs to the pharmacological class of sigma-1 receptor ligands (Mancuso & Navarro, 2017). Its chemical structure is based on adamantane derivatives that allow high-affinity binding to S1R, and it was initially synthesized as part of efforts to modulate neuroprotective pathways, with early investigations highlighting its ability to cross the blood–brain barrier and engage central nervous system targets (Cantarella et al., 2007). As a member of the sigma receptor modulators, PRE-084 has been developed for research applications in neuroprotection, and similar compounds of this class have traditionally been used in preclinical models of neurodegeneration, with particular emphasis on their ability to modulate intracellular calcium signaling at the mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (Mavlyutov et al., 2022). The molecule’s mechanism of action and physicochemical properties predict its potential for ocular uptake, making it a promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of ocular disorders like dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (Merlos et al., 2017).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, sigma-1 receptor agonists, including PRE-084, have been extensively investigated in various models of neurodegenerative and retinal diseases; preclinical studies in models of retinal ischemia–reperfusion injury and retinal ganglion cell degeneration have demonstrated robust neuroprotective effects following sigma-1 receptor activation (Mysona et al., 2017). Although PRE-084 has not been previously used in clinical trials specifically for dry AMD, its use in rodent retinal models has shown attenuation of oxidative damage, reduced ER stress, and protection against apoptosis in retinal neurons, which are all relevant mechanisms in dry AMD pathophysiology (Nguyen et al., 2015). In addition, studies employing sigma-1 receptor modulation in retinal cell lines and animal models of photoreceptor degeneration indicate that activation of S1R can lead to neuroprotection by stabilizing mitochondrial function and improving cellular autophagic responses (Bucolo et al., 2006). Furthermore, related sigma-1 receptor agonists such as (+)-pentazocine and cutamesine have been used to protect retinal integrity in experimental models, suggesting that the sigma-1 receptor ligand class possesses a strong preclinical track record in neuroprotection and retinal preservation, even though direct clinical use in human dry AMD has yet to be established (Merlos et al., 2017). The available preclinical safety data from central nervous system applications and rodent models further facilitate the repurposing of PRE-084 for ocular use given its acceptable tolerability profile in non-ocular settings (Mancuso & Navarro, 2017).

Mechanism of Action:
PRE-084 functions as a selective agonist at the sigma-1 receptor, a unique ligand-operated molecular chaperone that is predominantly localized at the mitochondria-associated ER membrane (MAM) (Cantarella et al., 2007). Upon binding to S1R, PRE-084 is known to facilitate key cellular processes including the regulation of intracellular calcium signaling by stabilizing the inositol triphosphate receptor (IP3R) complex; this stabilization promotes efficient calcium transfer from the ER to mitochondria, which is critical for maintaining mitochondrial bioenergetics and overall cell survival (Mancuso & Navarro, 2017). Activation of sigma-1 receptor by PRE-084 modulates the unfolded protein response (UPR) and attenuates ER stress by interacting with chaperone proteins such as BiP/GRP78, thereby restoring proteostasis under stressful cellular conditions (Wang et al., 2017). This agent also upregulates autophagic flux, allowing the cell to clear damaged proteins and organelles, which is paramount in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells that continuously manage large quantities of photoreceptor outer segments (Bucolo et al., 2006). Moreover, PRE-084 indirectly supports the antioxidant response by enhancing NRF2-mediated transcription, further protecting retinal cells from oxidative damage, a significant contributor to dry AMD pathology (Nguyen et al., 2015). In addition to ER stress modulation, sigma-1 receptor activation by PRE-084 has been shown to improve mitochondrial dynamics and reduce apoptosis markers such as Bax and caspase-3, thereby contributing to improved cell survival in neurodegenerative settings (Unknown Reference).

Expected Effect:
In the context of dry AMD, the proposed hypothesis is that PRE-084 will enhance ER–mitochondrial calcium signaling in RPE cells, ultimately promoting mitochondrial health, inducing autophagy, and improving the phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments (Mavlyutov et al., 2022). Given that RPE cells are critical for the maintenance and recycling of photoreceptor outer segments, the restoration of proper calcium homeostasis and the reduction in ER stress are expected to improve their ability to manage oxidative stress and maintain cellular viability (Ola et al., 2001). PRE-084 is anticipated to modulate key intracellular signaling pathways by activating sigma-1 receptors that are endogenously expressed in both RPE and retinal neuronal cells, thereby leading to a reduction in apoptosis and an increase in autophagic clearance of cellular debris (Merlos et al., 2017). This cellular protection should translate into improved retinal cell function and potentially slow the progression of dry AMD by preserving the structural and functional integrity of the RPE layer, which is central to photoreceptor nutrition and overall retinal health (Mysona et al., 2017). The expectation is supported by previous studies where sigma-1 receptor activation by similar ligands has resulted in sustained cell survival under conditions of oxidative and ER stress, effectively mitigating degenerative processes in retinal cells (Nguyen et al., 2015). PRE-084’s modulation of ER stress and mitochondrial function is hypothesized to promote efficient phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments—a process that is known to be compromised in dry AMD—and thereby restore RPE cell homeostasis (Wang et al., 2017).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, PRE-084 represents a promising therapeutic candidate for dry age-related macular degeneration due to its strong preclinical foundation in neuroprotection and its ability to modulate key cellular stress pathways implicated in retinal degeneration (Mancuso & Navarro, 2017). The strengths of this candidate include its well-documented mechanism of action involving the restoration of ER homeostasis, enhancement of mitochondrial bioenergetics, promotion of autophagy, and regulation of intracellular calcium signaling—all of which are critical in maintaining RPE cell function under stress conditions (Wang et al., 2017). Additionally, the sigma-1 receptor is known to be expressed in retinal cells and has been shown to confer protective effects in preclinical models of retinal neurodegeneration, which lends credence to the hypothesis that its activation by PRE-084 could prove beneficial in dry AMD (Cantarella et al., 2007; Nguyen et al., 2015). Furthermore, the small-molecule nature of PRE-084, coupled with its proven brain penetration, suggests that achieving sufficient ocular uptake may be feasible, thereby facilitating its translation into an ocular therapeutic (Mavlyutov et al., 2022). However, certain weaknesses and limitations must be considered—for instance, direct evidence of PRE-084’s efficacy specifically in RPE or dry AMD models remains limited, and detailed pharmacokinetic and ocular safety data are currently lacking (Merlos et al., 2017). Additionally, while preclinical data in neuroprotective and retinal degeneration models are promising, significant translational hurdles such as optimized ocular delivery, dose determination, and long-term safety profiling in humans will need to be addressed (Nguyen et al., 2015). In conclusion, PRE-084 has a solid mechanistic rationale and a strong preclinical record in related neurodegenerative contexts, making it an attractive candidate for further investigation in dry AMD; however, focused studies using RPE-specific and dry AMD-relevant models, as well as detailed ocular pharmacokinetic and safety evaluations, are imperative before advancing to clinical trials (Motawe et al., 2020; Mysona et al., 2017).

"ALX148 (Evorpacept, engineered SIRPα-Fc decoy)","Proposal for ALX148 (Evorpacept, engineered SIRPα-Fc decoy)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
ALX148, also known as evorpacept, is an engineered, high‐affinity SIRPα-Fc decoy protein designed to disrupt the inhibitory interaction between CD47 and SIRPα. This therapeutic candidate is a recombinant fusion protein in which the extracellular domain of SIRPα, the natural ligand for CD47, is genetically fused to the constant region (Fc) of human immunoglobulin G1 that has been modified to have an inactive Fc domain, thereby minimizing unwanted effector functions (Logtenberg et al., 2020). ALX148 was originally discovered and developed in the context of oncology, where blocking the CD47 “don’t eat me” signal has been shown to enhance the phagocytosis of tumor cells by macrophages; its design focuses on high specificity for CD47 and reduced Fc receptor engagement, which reduces off-target toxicity such as excessive erythrocyte clearance (Logtenberg et al., 2020). As a biologic, ALX148 belongs to the class of immune checkpoint modulators, and this class of compounds has been widely studied for applications in cancer immunotherapy, where similar agents have demonstrated the ability to modulate phagocytic activity in the tumor microenvironment (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Its synthesis relies on recombinant DNA technology and protein expression systems, which not only ensure a consistent manufacturing process but also facilitate modifications that can tune its binding affinity and pharmacologic properties for clinical applications (Logtenberg et al., 2020).

Therapeutic History:
The primary development history of ALX148 is rooted in oncology, where it has been evaluated in several early phase clinical trials addressing advanced solid tumors and lymphomas (U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2017; U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2022a). In these trials, ALX148 was administered either as a monotherapy or in combination with a variety of immune-enhancing agents such as immune checkpoint inhibitors and chemotherapies to counteract the CD47-mediated “don’t eat me” signal prevalent in cancer cells (U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2017). The mechanism exploited by ALX148 has been validated in preclinical tumor models, where targeting CD47 enhanced macrophage-mediated phagocytosis and improved anti-tumor immune responses (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). While ALX148 has an established clinical profile in oncology – with extensive safety and pharmacokinetic data now available from multi-center studies – there has been no direct prior clinical or veterinary use of ALX148 for treating dry age-related macular degeneration. However, the CD47-SIRPα signaling axis is recognized as a key regulator of phagocytosis in various tissues, including the retina, and its modulation has been implicated in maintaining immune homeostasis in neural tissues (Chen et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2022). A recent clinical trial in oncology further underscores the clinical-grade manufacturability and tolerability of ALX148, yet its repurposing for ocular diseases remains investigational and is supported only by mechanistic similarities between tumor-associated macrophage models and the phagocytic regulation observed in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells (U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2022b).

Mechanism of Action:
The fundamental mechanism of action of ALX148 revolves around its capacity to sequester CD47 on target cells, thus preventing the inhibitory binding of CD47 to its receptor SIRPα on phagocytes such as macrophages and microglia. Normally, CD47, widely expressed on many cell types including RPE cells and photoreceptor debris, binds to SIRPα to deliver a “don’t eat me” signal that suppresses subsequent phagocytosis (Chen et al., 2019; Logtenberg et al., 2020). By competitively binding to CD47, ALX148 disrupts this inhibitory interaction, thereby lifting the blockade on phagocytosis. In the context of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), where the accumulation of debris due to insufficient clearance by the RPE is a key pathogenic factor, ALX148 is hypothesized to enhance the uptake and degradation of photoreceptor outer segments and other cellular debris (Chen et al., 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additionally, by blocking CD47, ALX148 may indirectly promote anti-inflammatory cytokine production (such as TGF-β synthesis) that is normally enhanced when the CD47-SIRPα pathway is active, which can foster a more favorable retinal microenvironment that supports cellular homeostasis (Chen et al., 2019). The engineered SIRPα-Fc decoy is designed to have a high binding affinity for CD47 while minimizing Fc-dependent effector functions, thereby offering a targeted approach that reduces the risk of adverse events related to nonspecific immune cell activation (Logtenberg et al., 2020). In summary, ALX148’s molecular action involves interrupting the intrinsic immune checkpoint that normally hampers phagocytosis, transforming the microenvironment to one that is more conducive to debris clearance and tissue regeneration, which is pivotal in maintaining retinal integrity in dry AMD (Jiang et al., 2022).

Expected Effect:
The anticipated effect of ALX148 in the setting of dry AMD centers on enhancing the clearance of accumulated photoreceptor outer segments and other cellular debris by the RPE. In normal physiology, RPE cells continuously phagocytose shed outer segments from photoreceptors; however, in dry AMD, dysregulation of this process contributes to debris accumulation and subsequent retinal degeneration (Chen et al., 2019). By sequestering CD47 and nullifying its interaction with SIRPα, ALX148 is expected to lift the inhibitory “don’t eat me” signal, thereby increasing the phagocytic capacity of both tissue-resident macrophages and RPE cells (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Preclinical models investigating immune checkpoint modulation in ocular contexts have demonstrated that manipulating the CD47/SIRPα axis can facilitate increased clearance of cellular debris without eliciting overt inflammation, thereby preserving retinal architecture and function (Wang et al., 2021; Jiang et al., 2022). Furthermore, enhanced efferocytosis triggered by such interventions is associated with a subsequent reduction in chronic low-grade inflammation, which is an important pathogenic component in dry AMD, as it impairs tissue repair and cell survival (Chen et al., 2019; Logtenberg et al., 2020). It is anticipated that in the proposed assays, ALX148 will promote measurable increases in the uptake and degradation of outer segment debris by RPE cells, and, by doing so, help restore the normal homeostatic balance in the subretinal space. Moreover, the expression of CD47 on these cell types is well documented, and modulation of its signaling has been previously shown to impact phagocytic efficacy in analogous systems such as tumor-associated macrophages (Chen et al., 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Ultimately, the desired effect is not merely increased phagocytosis, but controlled enhancement that avoids collateral damage to healthy cells while mitigating the accumulation of pro-inflammatory debris that underpins AMD progression (Logtenberg et al., 2020).

Overall Evaluation:
The repurposing of ALX148 for dry AMD holds significant promise based on its well-characterized mechanism of action and established clinical safety profile in oncology. One major strength of ALX148 is its high affinity and specificity for CD47, which provides a precise means to disrupt the CD47-SIRPα inhibitory axis without triggering excessive off-target immune activation (Logtenberg et al., 2020). This engineered biologic has already been subjected to rigorous clinical evaluation in cancer patients (U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2017; U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2022b), which supports its manufacturability and potential safety in a chronic dosing regimen. The underlying hypothesis that ALX148 can lift the “don’t eat me” signal in RPE cells and enhance the clearance of photoreceptor debris is well grounded in the existing literature on CD47-SIRPα-mediated regulation of phagocytosis in the retina and central nervous system (Chen et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2022). In preclinical models of retinal degeneration, modulation of phagocytosis has shown beneficial effects, and similar immune checkpoint interventions in oncology further attest to the feasibility of this strategy (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

However, several weaknesses and challenges must be acknowledged. While the mechanism in oncology is robust, the ocular environment, particularly the immune-privileged status of the retina, poses unique challenges regarding drug delivery, local immune modulation, and safety (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). There is currently insufficient direct preclinical data on ALX148 in ocular models or specific clinical trials targeting dry AMD, indicating the need for rigorous in vivo studies to assess retinal-specific efficacy and potential adverse effects such as unintended overactivation of microglia or excessive clearance that might inadvertently harm viable photoreceptors (Logtenberg et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2019). Additionally, while ALX148 minimizes Fc receptor activation by employing an engineered Fc domain, the long-term effects of CD47 blockade in the retina remain uncertain, especially in regard to balancing enhanced phagocytosis with the risk of disrupting neuroprotective signals provided by the CD47-SIRPα interaction (Logtenberg et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2019). An inherent challenge of repurposing an agent from oncology is that its dosing regimen, systemic exposure, and pharmacodynamics may differ when applied to a localized ocular pathology, and robust ocular delivery strategies must be devised to ensure localized treatment without systemic spillover. Moreover, while the concept of enhancing RPE-mediated clearance is appealing, the modulation of phagocytosis in a diseased retina must be finely tuned to avoid precipitating inflammatory cascades that can exacerbate degeneration (Wang et al., 2021; Jiang et al., 2022).

In conclusion, ALX148 represents a compelling candidate for repurposing in dry AMD due to its engineered specificity for CD47, well-established mechanism in releasing the inhibitory phagocytosis checkpoint, and supportive clinical safety data in oncology settings (U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2017; Logtenberg et al., 2020). Its potential to enhance RPE-mediated clearance of photoreceptor debris addresses a critical unmet need in the treatment of dry AMD. However, to fully validate its therapeutic utility, additional investigations are required to generate ocular-specific preclinical data, optimize local delivery methodologies, and carefully monitor for any deleterious effects resulting from altered phagocytic regulation in retinal tissues (Chen et al., 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Overall, the strengths of ALX148 in terms of targeted mechanism, engineered safety, and clinically proven manufacturability are substantial, yet the transition from systemic oncology applications to localized ocular therapy will necessitate a cautious and thorough development program aimed at addressing the unique challenges of the retinal environment.

Below is a comprehensive evaluation of forskolin (catalog F6886, Sigma-Aldrich) as a repurposed drug candidate for dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD). This report is organized into five major sections: an Overview of the therapeutic candidate, its Therapeutic History, the Mechanism of Action in molecular detail, the Expected Effect in relevant assays, and an Overall Evaluation that discusses its advantages and challenges for treating dry AMD. The following discussion is based solely on the provided literature context.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Forskolin is a naturally derived labdane diterpenoid that is extracted from the roots of Coleus forskohlii (also referred to as Plectranthus barbatus). Its discovery is rooted in ethnobotanical research where traditional Indian medicinal practices guided its identification and initial application (Alasbahi & Melzig, 2010, pp. 10–11). As a natural compound within the diterpene family, forskolin is characterized by its direct activation of adenylyl cyclase without the need for receptor binding, a quality that sets it apart from other cAMP modulators. This mechanism of direct activation allows forskolin to rapidly elevate intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels across a variety of cell types (Alasbahi & Melzig, 2010, pp. 8–9). In addition, its low molecular weight contributes to favorable tissue penetration properties, a crucial consideration when targeting ocular tissues where the localized increase of cAMP is desired without significant systemic exposure. Forskolin’s chemical class, consisting of plant‐derived diterpenoid natural products, has been historically utilized both as a biochemical tool and as a therapeutic lead in cardiovascular, metabolic, respiratory, and ocular domains (Alasbahi & Melzig, 2010, pp. 10–11).

Therapeutic History:
Over the years, forskolin has accumulated an extensive therapeutic history across multiple biomedical fields. In cardiovascular research, forskolin has been used to induce positive inotropic effects and vasodilatory responses; early studies demonstrated its ability to stimulate myocardial adenylyl cyclase activity, thereby improving coronary blood flow and overall cardiac performance (Melzig, 2012, pp. 2–3). Its application in metabolic disorders has also been explored because of its ability to stimulate lipolysis via upregulation of cAMP in adipose tissues, which has been correlated with improvements in insulin secretion and body composition. In the realm of respiratory medicine, forskolin’s bronchodilatory effects have been documented, largely attributed to its capacity to relax airway smooth muscle, thereby attenuating symptoms associated with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Alasbahi & Melzig, 2010, pp. 8–9). More notably, in ophthalmology forskolin has been evaluated in preclinical studies for its ocular hypotensive effects. Topical administration in animal models such as rabbits and monkeys has shown that forskolin can lower intraocular pressure by decreasing aqueous humor formation through cAMP elevation in the ciliary epithelium (Alasbahi & Melzig, 2010, pp. 10–11; Shivaprasad et al., 2014, pp. 5–6). Although forskolin has not been directly used in clinical studies for dry AMD, its inclusion in drug screening assays using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells under oxidative stress conditions suggests that researchers have begun to explore its potential in diseases that share underlying cellular dysfunctions with dry AMD (Chang et al., 2014, pp. 5–7). Additionally, its broad use across oncology, systemic inflammation, and neuroprotection further supports its pleiotropic nature, despite the lack of direct translational studies linking it to retinal degenerative disease states (Salehi et al., 2019, pp. 10–12).

Mechanism of Action:
Forskolin’s well-established mechanism of action centers on its direct, receptor-independent activation of adenylyl cyclase. Once forskolin binds to the enzyme, it converts ATP to cyclic AMP at a rapid pace, resulting in a sharp increase in intracellular cAMP levels (Alasbahi & Melzig, 2010, p. 11). This elevation in cAMP is pivotal because it directly leads to the activation of downstream effectors such as protein kinase A (PKA) and exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP (Epac) (Melzig, 2012, pp. 7–8). Activation of these effectors initiates a series of phosphorylation events that culminate in changes in gene expression, modulation of cellular metabolism, and rearrangement of the cytoskeleton. In the context of RPE cells, the increase in cAMP is particularly important for promoting phagosome formation through the reorganization of actin filaments. PKA activation drives the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton, thereby supporting phagocytic receptor trafficking and the efficient uptake of photoreceptor outer segments (Alasbahi & Melzig, 2010, p. 11). Furthermore, some studies suggest that cAMP elevation via forskolin can lead to the inhibition of Rho kinase activity. The suppression of Rho kinase further facilitates the necessary cytoskeletal changes required for efficient phagocytosis as well as vesicular trafficking (Jun et al., 2022, pp. 8–9; Salehi et al., 2019, pp. 4–6). In addition to these primary actions, forskolin-mediated cAMP elevation has been noted to indirectly reduce inflammatory cytokine expression and mitigate cellular stress responses, both of which may play a secondary role in protecting retinal tissue from progressive degeneration (Rusciano, 2024, pp. 12–14).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis for repurposing forskolin in dry AMD is based on its ability to elevate cAMP in RPE cells, thereby triggering the activation of PKA and Epac signaling pathways. In theory, when administered locally—through topical or intravitreal routes—forskolin would achieve sufficiently high concentrations in the RPE so as to stimulate adenylyl cyclase effectively. The resulting increase in intracellular cAMP would then activate the PKA and Epac pathways, which are known to promote actin cytoskeleton remodeling. Such remodeling is essential for the proper trafficking of phagocytic receptors on the surface of RPE cells, a process that underpins the uptake and degradation of photoreceptor outer segments (Alasbahi & Melzig, 2010, pp. 10–11). In this model, enhancing the phagocytic capacity of RPE cells would lead to more efficient clearance of shed photoreceptor debris. This effect is anticipated to reduce the accumulation of toxic lipofuscin and other cellular waste products in the subretinal space—a recognized contributor to the pathogenesis of dry AMD (Salehi et al., 2019, pp. 8–10).

In experimental assays utilizing iPSC-derived RPE models, forskolin is expected to serve a dual role. Not only should it enhance the mechanical aspects of phagocytosis by promoting cytoskeletal reorganization, but its ability to modulate inflammatory signaling may also help alleviate the chronic oxidative stress and low-grade inflammation observed in the degenerating retina (Chang et al., 2014, pp. 5–7). Previous studies have demonstrated that compounds promoting cAMP elevation are associated with increased phagosome formation in various cell types, and this mechanistic link supports the potential of forskolin to restore or enhance photoreceptor outer segment clearance in RPE cells (Salehi et al., 2019, pp. 8–10). Additionally, early pharmacokinetic evaluations in ocular studies indicate that forskolin can be delivered locally with minimal systemic absorption. For instance, topical application studies in animal models have reported that forskolin eye drops produce a significant increase in ocular cAMP levels and a corresponding reduction in intraocular pressure (Karri, n.d., pp. 18–20; Steinle et al., 2021, pp. 1–3). While these studies were focused on glaucomatous endpoints rather than RPE function, they provide proof-of-concept that forskolin reaches ocular tissues and modulates cAMP-dependent processes in situ.

Overall, in assays aimed at measuring phagocytic uptake in RPE cells, one would expect forskolin treatment to translate into enhanced receptor trafficking and phagocytosis efficiency. In turn, this improved cellular clearance mechanism may ameliorate one of the fundamental defects observed in dry AMD, thereby slowing disease progression and preserving retinal structure and function.

Overall Evaluation:
In evaluating forskolin as a repurposed candidate for dry AMD, several compelling strengths are immediately apparent. The molecular mechanism of forskolin is one of the most clearly characterized among natural compounds. Its ability to directly activate adenylyl cyclase and elevate intracellular cAMP provides a well-defined biochemical pathway that is directly linked to the activation of both PKA and Epac. Given that these pathways regulate actin cytoskeleton remodeling and receptor trafficking—processes essential to the phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments—the mechanistic rationale is robust (Alasbahi & Melzig, 2010, p. 11; Melzig, 2012, pp. 2–3).

Another key advantage lies in its previous use in ocular applications. Forskolin has been evaluated for its intraocular pressure-reducing effects in glaucoma studies, demonstrating that it can be administered via topical ocular routes with measurable local efficacy and minimal systemic adverse effects (Shivaprasad et al., 2014, pp. 5–6; Steinle et al., 2021, pp. 3–4). These findings support the feasibility of employing similar administration techniques—whether topical or via intravitreal injection—to achieve localized therapeutic concentrations in the retina and specifically the RPE.

Moreover, forskolin’s inclusion in iPSC-derived RPE drug screening assays under oxidative stress conditions highlights its potential relevance to dry AMD (Chang et al., 2014, pp. 5–7). Although direct evidence showing forskolin–mediated enhancement of photoreceptor outer segment phagocytosis in RPE cells is still forthcoming, the established link between cAMP elevation and phagosome formation provides a strong hypothesis that justifies further research.

Despite these strengths, several challenges must be addressed. First, a notable weakness is the current paucity of direct preclinical or clinical evidence specifically showing that forskolin improves RPE phagocytosis or retards retinal degeneration in dry AMD models. Most existing studies have addressed endpoints such as intraocular pressure reduction in glaucoma or cardiopulmonary effects, rather than retinal debris clearance (Pay, 2017, pp. 230–239; Chang et al., 2014, pp. 5–7). Therefore, dedicated RPE‐specific in vitro and in vivo studies are critical before moving forward.

A second challenge is the delivery of forskolin to the outer retina. Data indicate that topical application of forskolin results in only a small fraction penetrating ocular tissues—for example, topical dosing in rabbits revealed that only about 0.03% of applied forskolin reached deeper ocular tissues (Karri, n.d., pp. 18–20). Such low penetration rates could limit its therapeutic efficacy in the RPE unless advanced drug delivery systems (e.g., nanoparticle-based formulations or sustained-release intravitreal implants) are developed to optimize tissue exposure, while still being safe for ocular administration.

Another point of caution is related to the broad effects of cAMP elevation. Forskolin does not act exclusively in RPE cells; its global activation of adenylyl cyclase could potentially elicit off-target effects in other retinal cell types (e.g., photoreceptors, endothelial cells) if dosing is not carefully controlled. Such non-specific modulation of cellular function might compromise retinal integrity. Thus, rigorous pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies are necessary to define a dosing regimen that maximizes RPE-specific effects while minimizing any potential adverse events (Rusciano, 2024, pp. 22–23; Salehi et al., 2019, pp. 4–6).

Furthermore, while the molecular rationale of forskolin’s mechanism is well established, many of its beneficial effects in the context of dry AMD remain theoretical. Although increased cAMP levels are associated with enhanced phagocytosis via PKA/Epac activation, it has not yet been definitively demonstrated that these molecular events translate into meaningful improvements in photoreceptor outer segment clearance or slowing of AMD progression in either animal models or human patients (Rusciano, 2024, pp. 15–16; Salehi et al., 2019, pp. 12–13). This gap in the literature must be addressed with carefully designed experiments using human RPE cells and dry AMD animal models.

From a strategic perspective, the strengths of forskolin as a candidate include its well-characterized, direct mechanism of action via adenylyl cyclase and its preexisting ocular use in the context of glaucoma. Its low molecular weight and capacity for localized delivery provide an attractive opportunity for maintaining high concentrations in the target tissue, while its anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective effects from cAMP signaling may add further value in the multifactorial pathology of dry AMD (Rusciano, 2024, pp. 7–9; Salehi et al., 2019, pp. 8–10). Conversely, the lack of direct evidence in RPE-focused and dry AMD-specific models, as well as the challenges associated with ocular penetration and possible off-target actions, represent significant hurdles that would need to be overcome.

Given these considerations, as a drug development team leader, I recommend allocating resources to conduct targeted preclinical studies designed to:
• Examine the impact of forskolin on phagocytic receptor trafficking and actin cytoskeleton remodeling in human RPE cell cultures.
• Evaluate the enhancement of photoreceptor outer segment clearance in iPSC-derived RPE models.
• Conduct in vivo studies using animal models that accurately recapitulate the dry AMD phenotype to assess both efficacy and ocular pharmacokinetics.
• Explore advanced drug delivery strategies—such as nanoparticle encapsulation or sustained-release formulations—to improve tissue penetration and achieve sustained RPE exposure.

In summary, forskolin represents a scientifically well-grounded candidate for repurposing in dry AMD based on its clearly defined mechanism of elevating intracellular cAMP, activating downstream PKA/Epac pathways, and modulating the actin cytoskeleton—a process that is crucial for effective phagocytosis in RPE cells (Alasbahi & Melzig, 2010, pp. 10–11; Melzig, 2012, pp. 7–8). Although its historical usage has been primarily in cardiovascular, metabolic, respiratory, and glaucoma-related applications, the mechanistic parallels between these effects and the cellular dysfunction observed in dry AMD are compelling. With the proper optimization of delivery methods and rigorous preclinical evaluation, forskolin holds the potential to restore RPE phagocytic function, reduce toxic debris accumulation, and ultimately slow the progression of dry AMD.

Thus, while significant work remains to establish definitive efficacy and safety in the context of dry AMD, the convergence of its biochemical actions, established ocular penetration capabilities, and preexisting evidence from related ocular studies supports further investigation of forskolin as a promising candidate. I recommend proceeding with a concerted preclinical research program focused on RPE-specific endpoints and innovative drug delivery systems to fully assess the translational potential of forskolin for dry age‐related macular degeneration (Rusciano, 2024, pp. 15–16; Salehi et al., 2019, pp. 12–13; Alasbahi & Melzig, 2010, p. 8; Jun et al., 2022, pp. 8–9).

In conclusion, given forskolin’s natural origins, well-established mechanism of cAMP elevation via adenylyl cyclase activation, and its documented ocular effects, it offers a strong scientific rationale for repurposing as an enhancer of RPE phagocytosis in dry AMD. However, careful attention must be paid to optimizing the delivery to the outer retina and minimizing off-target effects. With further targeted preclinical work, forskolin could eventually progress to clinical trials, potentially offering a novel therapeutic approach for a condition with very limited treatment options.

"Bardoxolone methyl (CDDO-Me, catalog S1498, Selleck Chemicals)","Proposal for Bardoxolone methyl (CDDO-Me, catalog S1498, Selleck Chemicals)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Bardoxolone methyl (also known as CDDO‐Me) is a synthetic oleanane triterpenoid derived from naturally occurring oleanolic acid, a plant-based compound with long-standing use in traditional medicine. Its synthesis involved chemical modifications of the oleanolic acid scaffold to enhance both its potency and bioavailability, resulting in a series of derivatives collectively classified as synthetic triterpenoids. This class of compounds has been developed to act as potent activators of the nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway, a major regulator of cellular detoxification and antioxidant defenses. Bardoxolone methyl, catalog S1498 from Selleck Chemicals, is a representative of these highly electrophilic agents that target cysteine residues on inhibitory proteins such as Keap1. The chemical modifications—often including the installation of cyano enone moieties—are designed to enable covalent binding to specific cysteines in Keap1, thereby preventing the usual ubiquitination and degradation of Nrf2. In essence, it couples the original natural product framework with modern medicinal chemistry techniques to create a molecule that has found applications primarily in conditions known to involve oxidative stress and inflammation (Camer et al., 2014; Sporn et al., 2011).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, Bardoxolone methyl has been developed and clinically evaluated for diseases characterized by chronic oxidative stress and inflammation. Notably, it has been studied in the context of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetic nephropathy, where clinical trials such as the BEAM and BEACON studies investigated its potential to improve renal function by modulating oxidative pathways. This extensive clinical experience in renal conditions provides important pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data that contribute to understanding its safety profile in human subjects. Although Bardoxolone methyl has not been directly approved for ocular indications, preclinical studies have demonstrated retinal protective effects in oxidative injury models, and its mechanism of action is highly relevant to the pathogenesis observed in dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD). The compound’s ability to induce Nrf2 and upregulate endogenous antioxidant enzymes has also been explored in other models of inflammation and oxidative stress, suggesting that it might be repurposed for diseases such as dry AMD where retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) oxidative damage is a major component of pathology (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Cheng et al., 2021).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, Bardoxolone methyl functions predominantly as an activator of the Nrf2 pathway. Under homeostatic conditions, Nrf2 is sequestered in the cytosol by Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), which facilitates its ubiquitin-dependent degradation, thereby maintaining low basal levels of antioxidant gene expression. Bardoxolone methyl disrupts this regulatory interaction through its electrophilic cyano enone moiety, which covalently modifies specific cysteine residues on Keap1, most notably Cys151. This modification prevents Keap1 from targeting Nrf2 for proteasomal degradation, allowing stabilized Nrf2 to accumulate, translocate into the nucleus, and dimerize with small Maf proteins. Once in the nucleus, the Nrf2 complex binds to antioxidant response elements (AREs) located in the promoters of various genes, leading to the robust transcription of phase II detoxification and antioxidant enzymes including NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and enzymes involved in glutathione synthesis such as glutamate-cysteine ligase. These events collectively result in enhanced cellular antioxidant capacity and cytoprotection against reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are central to the pathology of dry AMD. The activation of Nrf2 also indirectly influences autophagy pathways, potentially promoting lysosomal biogenesis and improved clearance of damaged proteins and organelles—a process critical for maintaining RPE homeostasis and efficient phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments (Naidu & Dinkova-Kostova, 2020; Nakagami et al., 2015; Nakagami, 2016).

Expected Effect:
In the context of dry AMD, the hypothesis is that Bardoxolone methyl, via its Nrf2-mediated mechanism, will upregulate antioxidant and autophagy genes in RPE cells. This upregulation is expected to reduce oxidative damage that is a hallmark of the disease and improve the efficiency of phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments, which is critical for retinal health. The anticipated biochemical effects include a decrease in the levels of ROS, an enhanced expression of cytoprotective enzymes, and an improvement in the autophagic flux within RPE cells. Because oxidative stress plays a fundamental role in the degeneration of the RPE and the subsequent loss of photoreceptor function in dry AMD, restoring redox homeostasis via Nrf2 activation is a promising therapeutic strategy. Additionally, increased lysosomal biogenesis, as a downstream effect of Nrf2 activation, could contribute to better phagosome clearance and improved recycling of photoreceptor outer segment material in RPE cells, thereby slowing disease progression. The expression of key Nrf2 target genes in RPE cells has been well-documented in preclinical studies, and some evidence suggests that pharmacologically induced Nrf2 activity protects these cells from oxidative injury (Cheng et al., 2021; Handa, 2012).

Overall Evaluation:
Bardoxolone methyl represents a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in the treatment of dry AMD due to several significant strengths. First, its well-characterized mechanism of action—a potent and specific activation of the Nrf2 pathway via disruption of Keap1–Nrf2 binding—is directly relevant to the oxidative stress observed in dry AMD. The compound’s ability to robustly upregulate antioxidant and detoxification genes provides a mechanistic rationale for its protective effects in the RPE. Second, the preclinical evidence that supports its retinal protective properties, combined with its potential to enhance autophagy and lysosomal function, aligns strongly with the cellular pathophysiology of dry AMD, where oxidative damage and inefficient phagocytic clearance are central contributors. Third, extensive clinical experience in chronic kidney disease, with detailed pharmacokinetic and safety profiles, offers a valuable starting point for repurposing efforts, providing key translational insights and reducing the early risk in drug development for an ocular indication (Mathis & Cui, 2016; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

However, there are also notable potential weaknesses and challenges that must be carefully addressed. Prior clinical trials in renal indications have revealed significant safety concerns, including adverse cardiovascular events, which underscore the narrow therapeutic window and potential systemic toxicities associated with potent Nrf2 activators (Vaziri et al., 2015; Tobalem & Uçkay, 2013). Therefore, while systemic administration of Bardoxolone methyl has been explored in kidney disease, its use for dry AMD might require localized ocular delivery strategies to minimize systemic exposure and side effects. Furthermore, there remains a paucity of direct clinical data for Bardoxolone methyl in retinal diseases despite encouraging preclinical findings, meaning that substantial preclinical and early clinical studies will be needed to specifically validate its safety and efficacy in the ocular setting. Another challenge is the possibility that chronic activation of Nrf2 could have off-target effects or result in a state of “reductive stress” if antioxidant responses are excessively induced, which may adversely impact cellular signaling pathways over time. Finally, while its oral formulation and previous human dosing data are strengths for translational considerations, the delivery mechanism suitable for retinal tissues might differ, necessitating novel formulation work.

In summary, Bardoxolone methyl’s profile as a potent Nrf2 activator with demonstrated systemic and preclinical antioxidant effects presents a strong scientific rationale for its repurposing in dry AMD. Its mechanism of disrupting Keap1–Nrf2 interactions to enhance endogenous antioxidative defenses and promote autophagy corresponds well to the known pathology of RPE degeneration in AMD. Nevertheless, the potential systemic side effects observed in earlier clinical trials, coupled with a lack of direct clinical evidence in ocular models, suggest that further preclinical studies and development of localized delivery systems will be critical to fully realize its therapeutic potential in the retinal context (Handa, 2012; Cheng et al., 2021). Overall, Bardoxolone methyl is a promising candidate that merits further investigation, provided that its dosing, delivery, and safety profiles can be optimized specifically for ocular application in dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Mathis & Cui, 2016).

"Liraglutide (Victoza®, catalog L4400, Sigma-Aldrich)","Proposal for Liraglutide (Victoza®, catalog L4400, Sigma-Aldrich)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Liraglutide (Victoza®, catalog L4400, Sigma-Aldrich) is a synthetic, long-acting analogue of the human incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Chemically, it is based on the native GLP-1 peptide but modified via acylation and amino acid substitutions to confer resistance to dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) degradation and extend its half-life to approximately 13 hours. Originally discovered and subsequently developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, liraglutide belongs to the class of GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists, which have been used for glycemic control and weight reduction in diabetic and obese patients (Mouhammad et al., 2022). The synthesis of liraglutide involves recombinant DNA technology and peptide chemical modification, making it a biologically derived product that has also been adapted for long-term therapeutic use. This same class of compounds has historically been used for metabolic regulation, and emerging evidence indicates that the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties of GLP-1R agonists may be exploitable in other conditions, including neurodegenerative and retinal diseases (Puddu & Maggi, 2022).

Therapeutic History:
Liraglutide was initially approved for type 2 diabetes and later for obesity, with an established safety profile in systemic clinical use. Over the past decade, numerous studies have investigated the pleiotropic effects of GLP-1R agonists beyond glycemic control. In preclinical models, agents such as exendin-4 and liraglutide have shown neuroprotective effects in models of Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and diabetic retinopathy (Bao et al., 2015; Mouhammad et al., 2022). Though the majority of clinical data relate to diabetes and cardiovascular endpoints, recent exploratory studies have examined the ocular effects of GLP-1R agonists. For example, topical administration of GLP-1 agonists in diabetic rodent models has demonstrated protection against retinal neurodegeneration without impacting blood glucose levels, thus suggesting a localized effect on retinal tissues (Hernández et al., 2016). However, a search on ClinicalTrials.gov using the terms “liraglutide AND macular degeneration” has returned no registered studies, indicating that no direct clinical investigation has been performed regarding liraglutide treatment in dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Despite the absence of direct clinical trials targeting dry AMD, the substantial body of preclinical and biochemical literature—ranging from neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory mechanisms to evidence of GLP-1R expression in ocular tissues—lays the groundwork for considering liraglutide as a repurposed therapy in dry AMD (Mouhammad et al., 2022; Márquez, 2016).

Mechanism of Action:
Liraglutide exerts its effects by binding to and activating the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that, upon activation, preferentially couples to the Gαs subunit. This coupling promotes activation of adenylate cyclase and an increase in intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. Elevated cAMP, in turn, activates protein kinase A (PKA) and other downstream effectors such as cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), ultimately leading to altered gene transcription and promoting cell survival, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidative responses (Bao et al., 2015).

In the context of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, several studies have confirmed the expression of GLP-1R and observed that activation of this receptor via agonists like liraglutide can lead to neuroprotective outcomes. Although direct evidence of enhanced phagocytic activity in RPE mediated by liraglutide remains preliminary, mechanistic insights derived from studies with exendin-4 and other GLP-1 analogues indicate that engagement of the cAMP/PKA pathway can upregulate the expression of phagocytic receptors such as MERTK and integrins. These receptors are critical for the actin-dependent engulfment of photoreceptor outer segments—a process that becomes impaired in dry AMD (Mouhammad et al., 2022; Puddu & Maggi, 2022). Additional insights from studies performed in other cell types suggest that activation of GLP-1R can lead to cytoskeletal rearrangements, enhancing the actin-dependent phagocytosis process (Sterling et al., 2021). Furthermore, the GLP-1R–cAMP/PKA signaling cascade modulates inflammatory cytokine production and oxidative stress responses, critical to preserving the function of RPE cells. In vitro data from macrophages and pancreatic β cells have provided evidence that GLP-1R activation is associated with the upregulation of genes involved in phagocytic function and cellular homeostasis, which supports the proposed mechanism in RPE cells (Bao et al., 2015; Puddu & Maggi, 2022).

It is important to note that while the direct demonstration of upregulated MERTK or integrin expression in RPE following liraglutide exposure is not fully established in the literature, the known downstream pathways of GLP-1R activation offer a compelling biochemical rationale. Activation of these signaling cascades may improve RPE phagocytosis by promoting actin-dependent engulfment—a process that is impaired in dry AMD. Thus, liraglutide’s mechanism of action, through sustained GLP-1R engagement, emulates neuroprotective signaling seen in other neurodegenerative diseases and offers the promise of targeted modulation of the RPE’s phagocytic machinery (Mouhammad et al., 2022; Márquez, 2016).

Expected Effect:
In the proposed therapeutic model, liraglutide is expected to enhance RPE function by specifically targeting and enhancing the phagocytic clearance of photoreceptor outer segment debris. The hypothesis is that activation of the GLP-1 receptor in RPE cells increases intracellular cAMP levels, thereby activating PKA. This activation leads to enhanced cytoskeletal dynamics that facilitate actin-dependent engulfment. Concurrently, the transcription of genes encoding for phagocytic receptors, such as MERTK and members of the integrin family, is anticipated to be upregulated. Efficient phagocytosis by RPE cells is critical for maintaining photoreceptor health and retinal integrity, and defects in this process are a key pathological mechanism underlying dry AMD (Márquez, 2016; Puddu & Maggi, 2022).

Preliminary in vitro data in other systems—including primary astrocytes and pancreatic β cells—support the notion that GLP-1R agonists can upregulate key phagocytic genes through the cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling cascade (Bao et al., 2015). If similar mechanisms are operative in RPE cells, liraglutide could restore or even enhance impaired phagocytic function, thereby reducing the accumulation of drusen and other debris characteristic of dry AMD. Moreover, by mitigating oxidative stress and inflammation—a process that is well documented with liraglutide treatment in neural tissues and retinal cells—the drug is anticipated to further protect the RPE from degeneration (Puddu & Maggi, 2022). Studies using topical administration in animal models have demonstrated that GLP-1R agonists can directly deliver neuroprotective benefits to retinal tissues independent of systemic glucose lowering (Hernández et al., 2016).

Given the established safety profile of liraglutide in human diabetic patients and its favorable tolerability in ocular preclinical models, the translation of these findings to a therapeutic setting in dry AMD appears promising. In summary, the expected effect is that liraglutide will restore RPE phagocytic function and improve the clearance of photoreceptor outer segments via enhanced GLP-1R–cAMP/PKA signaling, with secondary benefits from its anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic actions (Mouhammad et al., 2022; Puddu & Maggi, 2022).

Overall Evaluation:
Liraglutide presents as a highly promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of dry age-related macular degeneration due to several important strengths. First, its origin as a synthetic GLP-1R agonist with a long half-life offers a therapeutic advantage by providing sustained receptor engagement and biochemical activity. This extended activity may be critical in achieving persistent activation of the GLP-1R–cAMP/PKA signaling cascade in RPE cells, a pathway that is central to modulating phagocytic receptor expression and actin cytoskeletal rearrangements necessary for effective phagocytosis (Mouhammad et al., 2022). Second, the extensive clinical experience with liraglutide in type 2 diabetes and obesity means that its systemic safety profile is well documented, which is advantageous when considering repurposing for ocular applications (Mouhammad et al., 2022; Unknown Reference). Third, preclinical studies have provided compelling evidence that GLP-1R agonists confer neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects in the retina, especially when administered topically, making liraglutide potentially suitable for localized eye delivery with minimal systemic exposure (Hernández et al., 2016; Márquez, 2016).

However, there are certain weaknesses and areas of uncertainty that must be addressed to fully validate liraglutide’s applicability in dry AMD. One significant limitation is the relative paucity of direct experimental evidence specifically linking liraglutide to enhanced RPE phagocytosis. Although the hypothesis is underpinned by data from other cell types—including astrocytes and β cells—that demonstrate upregulation of phagocytic genes via GLP-1R activation (Bao et al., 2015), similar studies in primary human RPE cells that directly measure increases in MERTK, integrins, or actin-dependent engulfment are currently limited. Additionally, while the GLP-1 receptor has been detected in the retina and even in isolated RPE cell lines in some studies, there remains some debate regarding its expression levels and distribution in human retinal tissues, as conflicting reports have been published using different detection methods (Hebsgaard et al., 2018).

Furthermore, while the excellent tolerability and safety profile of liraglutide in diabetic patients provide reassurance, ocular-specific safety data—especially with respect to long-term topical administration—are still emerging. Preclinical studies suggest minimal retinal adverse effects, but the translation of these results to chronic human administration in a dry AMD population requires careful clinical investigation. Clinical trial data regarding the use of GLP-1R agonists in retinal diseases have largely focused on diabetic retinopathy, and although some literature reports neutral or even protective effects in diabetic cohorts (Hernández et al., 2016), direct evidence in a dry AMD context is lacking (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

In conclusion, liraglutide is a strong candidate for repurposing toward dry AMD based on its established mechanism of action through GLP-1R–cAMP/PKA signaling, its potential to upregulate phagocytic receptors and promote actin-dependent processes, and its well-characterized systemic safety profile. The strengths of liraglutide include its long half-life, potential for localized ocular delivery, and pleiotropic protective effects that include anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective actions. However, the weaknesses lie in the need for more direct experimental evidence in RPE cells, clarity regarding GLP-1R expression in human retinal tissues, and the necessity for dedicated clinical trials to assess its efficacy and safety in dry AMD. Given these factors, further preclinical studies focusing specifically on RPE phagocytosis and subsequent phase I/II clinical trials in a dry AMD population are warranted before a full translational pipeline can be established (Mouhammad et al., 2022; Puddu & Maggi, 2022; Hernández et al., 2016).

"Pioglitazone (Actos®, catalog PZ004, Sigma-Aldrich)","Proposal for Pioglitazone (Actos®, catalog PZ004, Sigma-Aldrich)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Pioglitazone (Actos®, catalog PZ004, Sigma-Aldrich) is a synthetic compound belonging to the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class, a family of PPARγ agonists originally discovered and developed to improve insulin sensitivity in patients with type 2 diabetes. The TZD drugs were designed based on structure–activity relationship studies aimed at modulating a nuclear transcription factor that regulates genes controlling lipid and glucose homeostasis. Pioglitazone, specifically, was synthesized through organic chemistry methods that introduce a thiazolidinedione moiety fused with an aromatic group to promote binding to the ligand-binding domain of PPARγ. This chemical class has a well-established history in metabolic modulation and anti-inflammatory applications. Their capability to bind to PPARγ alters gene transcription patterns in a variety of tissues. Beyond its antidiabetic effects, emerging research has demonstrated that PPARγ activation has pleiotropic effects in other tissues, including the retina, where modulating inflammation and cellular homeostasis are critical factors in disease progression (Zhang, Gu, & Hu, 2015, pp. 3–4).

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic utility of pioglitazone has been extensively evaluated in the context of type 2 diabetes, where its insulin-sensitizing properties, favorable oral pharmacokinetics, and an established safety profile in diabetic cohorts have made it a mainstay in chronic metabolic management. Clinically, pioglitazone has been used for decades to manage hyperglycemia and to mitigate the long-term vascular complications of diabetes. Beyond its metabolic use, a growing body of research has focused on its anti-inflammatory effects—specifically its ability to downregulate pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β—and on its capacity to improve oxidative stress resistance in various tissues. Preclinical studies in ocular models, including some in diabetic retinopathy and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cell models, have shown that pioglitazone can protect retinal cells from oxidative injury and, importantly, support cellular processes linked to phagocytosis and autophagosome–lysosome fusion. Although direct clinical trials in dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) are lacking, evidence from experimental models implies that a similar mechanism of RPE preservation might be achievable with pioglitazone. In diabetic retinopathy studies, pioglitazone has been associated with retinal microvascular improvements and neuroprotection—findings that are encouraging when considering its potential repurposing for dry AMD, a disease characterized by chronic inflammation, RPE dysfunction, and impaired clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Khatol, Saraf, & Jain, 2018, pp. 4–9).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, pioglitazone functions as an agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), a nuclear receptor that, upon ligand binding, heterodimerizes with the retinoid X receptor (RXR). This complex then binds to specific PPAR response elements (PPREs) in the promoter regions of target genes, thereby modulating their transcription. The genes regulated by PPARγ include those involved in lipid metabolism, cell differentiation, insulin sensitivity, and inflammatory responses. In retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, PPARγ is expressed and appears to be dynamically regulated during phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments—a process essential for photoreceptor renewal and retinal homeostasis. Activation of PPARγ by pioglitazone has been shown to suppress key pro-inflammatory mediators, reducing the activation of transcription factors such as NF-κB and AP-1, which in turn leads to decreased expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, and other cytokines implicated in chronic ocular inflammation. This anti-inflammatory mechanism is crucial, as inflammation is a key driver of RPE degeneration in dry AMD. Moreover, PPARγ agonism is associated with enhanced antioxidant responses, an effect partly mediated by increased glutathione (GSH) levels and activation of downstream kinases such as MAPK. There is emerging evidence suggesting that PPARγ activation may also promote autophagic flux by upregulating genes associated with lysosomal biogenesis and autophagosome formation, potentially leading to an improved fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. This enhanced autophagic clearance is particularly relevant in the context of dry AMD, where accumulation of photoreceptor outer segment debris due to impaired degradation contributes to RPE dysfunction and drusen formation. In summary, the molecular interactions of pioglitazone include:
– Binding to the ligand-binding pocket of PPARγ and promoting its heterodimerization with RXR.
– Transcriptional regulation of antioxidant defenses, inflammatory mediators, and lipid handling genes.
– Modulation of autophagy-related processes, which may result in improved autophagosome–lysosome fusion and clearance of toxic protein/lipid aggregates in the RPE (Zhang, Gu, & Hu, 2015, pp. 3–4; Choudhary & Malek, 2016, pp. 11–12; Di Rosa et al., 2016, pp. 15–16).

Expected Effect:
Based on the hypothesis and the known actions of pioglitazone, the expected effect in dry AMD would be multifactorial. First, by activating PPARγ, pioglitazone is anticipated to reduce the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the RPE and neighboring retinal tissues, thereby attenuating the chronic inflammatory milieu observed in dry AMD. The decrease in cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β would mitigate immune-mediated damage to the RPE, which is critical given that inflammation is a major contributor to the progression of RPE atrophy in dry AMD. Second, pioglitazone is expected to enhance autophagy by promoting autophagosome–lysosome fusion in RPE cells. This improved autophagic clearance could lead to more efficient degradation of photoreceptor outer segments, which accumulate as lipofuscin and other toxic deposits when clearance is compromised. The phagocytic function of RPE is essential for maintaining the health of photoreceptors, and dysfunction in this process is a hallmark of dry AMD pathology. Third, the drug’s capacity to upregulate antioxidant defenses should help protect RPE cells from oxidative stress, a well-known trigger for cellular degeneration in retinal diseases. Importantly, the expression of PPARγ in RPE cells has been demonstrated in several studies, and its selective upregulation during photoreceptor outer segment phagocytosis suggests that modulating this receptor could directly influence the degradative pathways needed for photoreceptor maintenance. Ultimately, the combined anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and autophagy-enhancing effects of pioglitazone are hypothesized to slow or even halt the progression of dry AMD by preserving RPE health and function, thereby maintaining photoreceptor integrity and visual function (Zhang, Gu, & Hu, 2015, pp. 6–7; Brooks et al., 2023, pp. 6–7; Khatol et al., 2018, pp. 28–30).

Overall Evaluation:
Pioglitazone presents as a promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of dry AMD based on several compelling factors. One of the major strengths of pioglitazone is its well-characterized safety profile. Having been in clinical use for the management of type 2 diabetes for many years, its pharmacokinetic properties and systemic tolerability are well documented. This existing clinical data provides an advantageous starting point for repurposing, potentially reducing development time and facilitating regulatory approval if efficacy in dry AMD can be demonstrated. Moreover, the molecular mechanism of pioglitazone—centered on PPARγ activation—addresses several key pathological processes implicated in dry AMD. The drug’s anti-inflammatory effects, demonstrated by its ability to downregulate pro-inflammatory cytokines and modulate NF-κB signaling, are directly relevant to mitigating the chronic retinal inflammation observed in dry AMD. Additionally, the potential of pioglitazone to promote autophagic clearance by enhancing autophagosome–lysosome fusion in RPE cells is a highly attractive feature given that defective clearance of photoreceptor outer segments is implicated in the accumulation of drusen and subsequent RPE dysfunction. Experimental data suggest that PPARγ expression in RPE cells is upregulated during phagocytosis, indicating that pharmacologic activation of this pathway could restore or enhance the degradative capability of these cells. Furthermore, its ability to enhance antioxidant defenses provides a dual protective effect against the oxidative stress that drives retinal degeneration. However, there are some potential weaknesses and challenges that must be considered. Despite its established safety in diabetic cohorts, pioglitazone is not without side effects; systemic administration of TZDs has been associated with fluid retention and, in some cases, an increased risk of macular edema, as noted in some observational studies of diabetic populations. These safety concerns underscore the need for careful dosing regimens and possibly targeted ocular delivery strategies to minimize systemic exposure while maximizing retinal drug levels. Additionally, while preclinical retinal models have shown encouraging results, direct clinical evidence supporting the efficacy of pioglitazone in dry AMD is lacking at present. The proposed mechanisms, though robust in theory and supported by studies in diabetic retinopathy and other ocular inflammatory models, require validation specifically in the context of dry AMD. Rigorous in vitro studies using RPE cell cultures and in vivo models of dry AMD will be necessary to establish the effectiveness of pioglitazone in improving autophagy, reducing inflammation, and preserving photoreceptor function. Finally, the multifactorial nature of dry AMD pathogenesis means that a single-agent approach might not be sufficient in all cases, and combination therapies may ultimately be needed to address the complex interplay of oxidative stress, inflammation, and autophagy deficits. In summary, pioglitazone’s established pharmacological profile, known receptor-mediated mechanisms, and experimental evidence in retinal cell models provide a strong rationale for its further investigation as a therapeutic agent for dry AMD. However, given the potential side effects and the current lack of direct clinical efficacy data in dry AMD, a careful and systematic preclinical and early-phase clinical evaluation is warranted before advancing into large-scale clinical trials (Choudhary & Malek, 2016, pp. 11–12; Khatol et al., 2018, pp. 22–24; Zhang, Gu, & Hu, 2015, pp. 7–8).

Overall, our comprehensive evaluation indicates that pioglitazone exhibits several desirable features as a candidate for repurposing in dry AMD treatment. Its capacity to modulate inflammatory gene expression, enhance antioxidant defenses, and potentially improve autophagosome–lysosome fusion in RPE cells aligns directly with our therapeutic hypothesis. The drug’s favorable oral pharmacokinetics and existing extensive clinical safety record in diabetic populations further strengthen its translational feasibility. Nonetheless, targeted studies focusing on retinal-specific outcomes—including assessments of RPE autophagy, photoreceptor outer segment clearance, and ocular fluid dynamics—are essential to confirm its efficacy and optimize dosage specifically for the treatment of dry AMD. These investigations should include both mechanistic in vitro assays using RPE models and in vivo animal studies that mimic the chronic degenerative processes of dry AMD, followed by carefully designed early-phase clinical trials. Given the multifactorial pathology of dry AMD, pioglitazone may be most effective as part of a combination approach that addresses other contributing mechanisms such as oxidative stress and abnormal lipid metabolism. In conclusion, while challenges remain, the current literature supports pioglitazone as a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry AMD that merits further detailed investigation in preclinical and clinical settings (Core et al., 2023, pp. 4–6; Di Rosa et al., 2016, pp. 15–16; Nadeem et al., 2022, pp. 14–15).

"Ebselen (catalog E1014, Sigma-Aldrich)","Proposal for Ebselen (catalog E1014, Sigma-Aldrich)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Ebselen is a synthetic organoselenium compound chemically defined as 2-phenyl-1,2-benzisoselenazol-3(2H)-one. Its discovery dates back nearly a century when early pioneers such as Lesser and Weiss first investigated selenium‐containing aromatic compounds, and its modern development evolved through refined synthetic routes. Early synthetic methods involve the use of anthranilic acid derivatives which, through diazotization followed by selenenylation with disodium diselenide, yield key intermediates that are then treated with chlorine sources (for example, thionyl chloride) to form a chloroseleno benzoyl chloride intermediate; subsequent acylation with an amine leads to the benzisoselenazolone core (Bhabak & Mugesh, 2007, pp. 1–2; Martins & Mendes, 2020, pp. 295–297). Alternative synthetic approaches include one-pot procedures that involve ortho-lithiation of benzanilides to create dianion intermediates, insertion of elemental selenium, and finally oxidative cyclization in the presence of copper catalysts – a method which has contributed to increased overall yield and efficiency (Martins & Mendes, 2020, pp. 317–320). In more modern iterations, ebselen analogues have been synthesized through convergent methodologies where diverse substituents are appended onto the benzisoselenazolone scaffold to tailor its biological activity (Crocetti et al., 2024, pp. 1–2; Durand, 2013, pp. 6–8). Ebselen belongs to the class of organoselenium heterocycles, a group of compounds known for their inherent redox activity, which derives from the presence of a selenium atom within a cyclic framework. This class has historically been used as antioxidants given their activity as mimics of the endogenous enzyme glutathione peroxidase (GPx); these compounds catalytically reduce hydroperoxides and intercept reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby protecting cellular components from oxidative damage (Crocetti et al., 2024, pp. 1–2; Bhabak & Mugesh, 2007, pp. 1–2). The fact that ebselen is a low-molecular-weight aromatic heterocycle with good lipid solubility contributes to its ability to cross biological barriers, a property that has facilitated its exploration across multiple therapeutic areas.

Therapeutic History:
Ebselen’s therapeutic history is extensive and multifaceted. Initially characterized for its GPx-mimetic activity, ebselen was investigated in biochemical studies that confirmed its capacity to catalyze the reduction of hydroperoxides by using endogenous thiols such as reduced glutathione (GSH) (Mugesh, du Mont, & Sies, 2001, pp. 3–4). Early preclinical studies, conducted in various animal models, demonstrated that ebselen could attenuate oxidative stress in organs such as the brain and liver, significantly reducing lipid peroxidation and inflammatory markers in models of ischemia-reperfusion injury and acute liver damage (Mugesh, du Mont, & Sies, 2001, pp. 3–4; Durand, 2013, pp. 6–8). Clinical efforts primarily centered on its use as a neuroprotective agent in stroke, with early clinical trials investigating its effects in acute middle cerebral artery occlusion. Though these trials provided some evidence of neuroprotective benefit and confirmed a favorable short-term safety profile, particularly due to its inability to release free selenium and resulting minimal toxicity, ebselen did not ultimately secure regulatory approval in these areas (Parnham & Sies, 2013, pp. 1–2, 4–5).

Beyond its application in neurologic injuries, ebselen has been evaluated in diverse fields such as inflammatory disorders and psychiatric conditions. For instance, its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory profile has led to studies investigating its potential utility in treatment-resistant depression and other neuropsychiatric disorders, capitalizing on its ability to modulate redox-dependent signaling pathways (Ramli, Cowen, & Godlewska, 2022, pp. 2–4; Pacuła et al., 2017, pp. 13–15). Additionally, investigations in non-neural tissues, including its effects on systemic inflammation and its role as a potential renoprotective and hepatoprotective agent, have been documented. Although numerous preclinical studies have shown that ebselen can reduce oxidative damage in models of chronic ethanol-induced injury in the retina or other tissues, there is to date no direct history of its clinical use in dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) or retinal disorders (Azad & Tomar, 2014, pp. 9–10; Aitken et al., 2012, pp. 1–2). Its exploration in ocular contexts has been largely inferred from its demonstrated capacity to lower oxidative stress in tissue models and its favorable barrier-crossing properties (Aitken et al., 2012, pp. 1–2; Pacuła et al., 2017, pp. 13–15). Thus, while ebselen has been extensively studied in non-ocular models – including its evaluation in ischemic brain injury and inflammatory conditions – its direct application to dry AMD remains untested in clinical trials, representing a new frontier for repurposing efforts.

Mechanism of Action:
On a molecular level, ebselen’s mechanism of action derives primarily from its ability to mimic the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), a critical enzyme responsible for the detoxification of hydroperoxides. This GPx-mimetic activity is enabled by the redox-active selenium atom that cycles between different oxidation states. In its catalytic cycle, ebselen initially reacts with reduced glutathione (GSH) to form a selenenyl sulfide intermediate; this intermediate undergoes subsequent reduction by additional equivalents of GSH to regenerate the original active selenol form of ebselen, thereby allowing it to continuously convert reactive hydroperoxides – for example, hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) and lipid hydroperoxides – into benign alcohol derivatives (Mugesh, du Mont, & Sies, 2001, pp. 3–4; Bhabak & Mugesh, 2007, pp. 1–2). In this redox cycle, the selenium atom cycles through oxidation states that include the selenol (–SeH), selenenic acid (–SeOH), and seleninic acid (–SeO₂H) forms; each of these states plays a specific role in intercepting and neutralizing reactive oxygen species, thereby maintaining cellular redox balance (Mugesh, du Mont, & Sies, 2001, pp. 3–4).

In addition to its catalytic behavior, ebselen exhibits reactivity toward protein thiol groups, forming reversible covalent bonds with reactive cysteine residues. This capacity to bind thiols can result in the protection or regulation of redox-sensitive enzymes, notably those found in lysosomal compartments. Lysosomal enzymes, which rely on free cysteine residues to maintain their catalytic function, are particularly vulnerable to oxidative modifications. Ebselen’s preferential binding to these thiol moieties may prevent oxidative inactivation of these enzymes, thereby preserving their function in the phagolysosomal degradation of photoreceptor debris – a process critical for retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell health (Azad & Tomar, 2014, pp. 8–9; Zhao & Holmgren, 2002, p. 39456).

Furthermore, ebselen is known to inhibit several key enzymes involved in the propagation of inflammatory responses, such as lipoxygenases and NADPH oxidases. Inhibition of these enzymes contributes to its anti-inflammatory effect by reducing the production of pro-inflammatory mediators and lowering the overall cellular oxidant burden. Consequently, ebselen functions at the intersection of antioxidant defence and inflammatory regulation, which positions it as a promising candidate for conditions where oxidative stress and chronic inflammation are underlying drivers of pathology (Parnham & Sies, 2013, pp. 3–4; Durand, 2013, pp. 6–8). Such dual functionality is pivotal in the context of dry AMD, where both oxidative stress and impaired waste clearance by RPE cells – resulting from lysosomal dysfunction – lead to the accumulation of photoreceptor byproducts and subsequent retinal degeneration.

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis driving the repurposing of ebselen for dry age-related macular degeneration is that its robust antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions can alleviate oxidative stress in RPE cells, thereby preserving lysosomal enzyme activity and promoting effective phagolysosomal degradation of photoreceptor debris. Dry AMD is characterized by chronic oxidative stress in the retinal pigment epithelium, which leads to lysosomal dysfunction, accumulation of drusen, and eventual RPE cell death. In this scenario, ebselen is expected to play several beneficial roles:

First, by virtue of its GPx-mimetic activity, ebselen will catalytically neutralize intracellular hydroperoxides and other ROS. This reduction in oxidant levels is anticipated to protect the cellular membranes, proteins, and nucleic acids of RPE cells from oxidative damage, thereby sustaining cell viability and function over time (Mugesh, du Mont, & Sies, 2001, pp. 3–4; Parnham & Sies, 2013, pp. 1–2). Reduced oxidative stress should in turn mitigate the secondary inflammatory responses that are typically observed in dry AMD.

Second, ebselen’s reactivity with protein thiol groups is expected to safeguard lysosomal enzymes from oxidative inactivation. In RPE cells, lysosomal function is crucial for the daily phagocytic clearance of shed photoreceptor outer segments. Oxidative modifications of key lysosomal enzymes impair this process, leading to the accumulation of cellular debris and the formation of drusen – hallmark features of dry AMD. By binding to the thiol groups of these enzymes, ebselen may prevent or reverse the deleterious oxidative modifications, thereby preserving lysosomal activity and restoring efficient phagolysosomal degradation (Azad & Tomar, 2014, pp. 8–9; Zhao & Holmgren, 2002, p. 39456).

Third, the molecular size and aromatic character of ebselen facilitate its ability to cross ocular barriers. Studies in other systems, particularly those investigating neuroprotective effects where ebselen is known to cross the blood–brain barrier, support the expectation that ebselen can similarly penetrate the ocular tissues to reach the RPE in therapeutically relevant concentrations (Pacuła et al., 2017, pp. 13–15; Aitken et al., 2012, pp. 1–2). Such penetration is essential for any drug candidate targeting the retina, given the complexity of the ocular barriers.

Moreover, the anti-inflammatory properties of ebselen are also expected to contribute to its therapeutic efficacy in dry AMD. By inhibiting enzymes such as lipoxygenases and NADPH oxidases, ebselen can decrease the synthesis and release of inflammatory cytokines and mediators that exacerbate tissue damage in the retina. A reduction in local inflammation is anticipated to create a more conducive environment for the recovery of RPE function, further enhancing phagocytic clearance mechanisms (Azad & Tomar, 2014, pp. 9–10; Aitken et al., 2012, pp. 1–2).

In a comprehensive preclinical assay designed to evaluate its effect in RPE cells, ebselen is expected to demonstrate a significant reduction in intracellular ROS levels, preservation or enhancement of lysosomal enzyme activity, and improved clearance of photoreceptor outer segment debris. This combination of outcomes should translate into a stabilization or even improvement in the functional health of the RPE layer – a key therapeutic goal in managing dry AMD. Additionally, because several of the proteins involved in phagocytosis and lysosomal function are known to be redox-sensitive, its ability to modulate the oxidative state indirectly supports the functional integrity of these cellular processes, further underlining its potential effectiveness in this indication.

Overall Evaluation:
In light of the chemical, biochemical, and pharmacological data, ebselen emerges as a strong candidate for repurposing in the treatment of dry age-related macular degeneration. One of the most compelling strengths of ebselen is its well-documented ability to mimic glutathione peroxidase activity, enabling it to function as a catalytic antioxidant that continuously reduces hydroperoxides and maintains cellular redox homeostasis (Mugesh, du Mont, & Sies, 2001, pp. 3–4; Bhabak & Mugesh, 2007, pp. 1–2). This antioxidant capacity is critical in the RPE, where oxidative stress is a major driver of lysosomal dysfunction and consequent photoreceptor debris accumulation, both of which underlie the pathogenesis of dry AMD.

Another notable strength is ebselen’s dual mechanism of action. In addition to its GPx-mimetic activity, its ability to form covalent bonds with protein thiols provides a potential means of protecting or restoring the function of redox-sensitive lysosomal enzymes. Given that impaired lysosomal degradation is central to the failure of RPE cells to properly clear photoreceptor outer segments, restoring this pathway is anticipated to mitigate drusen formation and the subsequent cascade of retinal degeneration (Azad & Tomar, 2014, pp. 8–9; Zhao & Holmgren, 2002, p. 39456).

Furthermore, the compound’s pharmacokinetic profile appears favorable. Its small, aromatic, and lipophilic structure increases the likelihood of efficient penetration across ocular barriers. Evidence from neuroprotective studies – where ebselen successfully crosses the blood–brain barrier – supports its potential to achieve effective retinal concentrations, a necessary prerequisite for any drug intended to treat retinal diseases (Pacuła et al., 2017, pp. 13–15; Aitken et al., 2012, pp. 1–2). Additionally, its safety profile established in clinical trials for neurologic and psychiatric disorders implies that chronic administration, as would be required in dry AMD management, might be feasible with minimal systemic toxicity (Parnham & Sies, 2013, pp. 4–5; Ramli, Cowen, & Godlewska, 2022, pp. 2–4).

However, there are several challenges and gaps that need to be addressed. Despite the compelling mechanistic rationale and supportive biochemical evidence from models of oxidative injury and inflammation, direct evidence of ebselen’s efficacy in established models of dry AMD is scarce. Although some studies using models of chronic ethanol-induced oxidative stress in the retina have indicated potential benefit, there is a translational gap between these indirect models and the complex pathology of dry AMD (Azad & Tomar, 2014, pp. 9–10; Aitken et al., 2012, pp. 1–2). Dedicated preclinical studies in animal models that more accurately recapitulate AMD pathology are required to establish its effectiveness in an ocular context.

Moreover, ebselen’s broad reactivity with thiol groups, while advantageous for preserving lysosomal enzyme activity, also poses a risk of off-target interactions. Its propensity to form covalent adducts with cysteine residues in other proteins might lead to unintended modulation of critical cellular processes in the highly specialized RPE cells. This non-specificity could potentially result in unwanted side effects, particularly over long-term treatment scenarios required for chronic diseases such as dry AMD (Durand, 2013, pp. 6–8; Abdur & Huang, 2016, pp. 98–102). Detailed toxicological studies on ocular tissues are therefore necessary to ensure that sustainable dosing does not compromise retinal integrity.

An additional challenge pertains to the current paucity of ocular pharmacokinetic data. Parameters such as retinal tissue penetration, intraocular half-life, and clearance rates are largely undefined for ebselen. Given that successful treatment of dry AMD requires maintaining therapeutic concentrations in the retina over extended periods, comprehensive ocular biodistribution studies are critical to optimize dosing regimens and determine the feasibility of different administration routes (Macegoniuk et al., 2023, pp. 9–10; May, 2015, pp. 93–95).

Finally, while the anti-inflammatory profile of ebselen is attractive, caution should be exercised due to the potential for broad immunomodulation. In the delicate microenvironment of the retina, where controlled inflammatory responses are essential for tissue remodeling and repair, any intervention that excessively suppresses inflammation could disrupt homeostatic processes. Therefore, the balance between antioxidant benefits and the risk of excessive anti-inflammatory suppression must be carefully calibrated in future studies.

In conclusion, ebselen presents a compelling profile as a candidate for repurposing in dry age-related macular degeneration. The robust mechanistic rationale – characterized by its GPx-mimetic activity, preservation of lysosomal enzyme function via thiol reactivity, and favorable physicochemical properties that support ocular penetration – aligns well with the key pathogenic processes underlying dry AMD. Although its therapeutic history does not include direct clinical application in ocular diseases, the extensive body of preclinical and clinical research in other contexts provides a strong foundation for further exploration.

To advance ebselen as a potential treatment for dry AMD, we recommend initiating a rigorous preclinical research program using well-established animal models of AMD. These studies should focus on determining the compound’s ocular pharmacokinetics, its effect on RPE cell oxidative status, lysosomal enzyme activity, and the efficiency of photoreceptor outer segment degradation. Detailed molecular assays to evaluate changes in redox-sensitive markers and inflammatory mediators in the retina will also be critical. Should these preclinical studies yield positive results, the promising safety profile of ebselen observed in CNS and psychiatric clinical trials would support the rationale for early-phase clinical trials in patients with dry AMD.

Overall, despite existing gaps in the direct evidence linking ebselen to improved outcomes in dry AMD, its multifaceted pharmacological profile, combined with a well-understood mechanism of action and favorable physicochemical properties, makes it a highly promising therapeutic candidate. Its repurposing could address the significant unmet medical need in dry AMD by targeting both oxidative stress and impaired phagolysosomal degradation, two central drivers of disease progression. Rigorous preclinical validation and targeted ocular pharmacokinetic studies will be essential next steps in determining whether ebselen can effectively translate its biochemical promise into clinical benefit for dry AMD patients (Parnham & Sies, 2013, pp. 3–4; Azad & Tomar, 2014, pp. 9–10; Aitken et al., 2012, pp. 1–2).

"Probucol (catalog P9425, Sigma-Aldrich)","Proposal for Probucol (catalog P9425, Sigma-Aldrich)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Probucol is a synthetic bisphenol compound originally developed as a lipid‐lowering agent to treat hyperlipoproteinemia and cardiovascular diseases. Its synthesis and development date back several decades, and its chemical structure confers both lipophilic and antioxidant properties. As a member of the antioxidant and lipid‐modulating drug class, probucol has been utilized primarily for its ability to lower cholesterol levels and inhibit lipid peroxidation. Traditionally, this class of compounds has been used to manage atherosclerosis and related cardiovascular conditions by reducing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation and attenuating inflammatory processes in blood vessels (Cai et al., 2021, pp. 5–6; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
Probucol’s therapeutic history is extensive in the context of cardiovascular disease management; it has been well documented as a lipid-lowering agent with robust antioxidant efficacy. In preclinical studies, probucol has reduced oxidative stress markers, inhibited lipid peroxidation, and shown anti-inflammatory effects in several tissues. Notably, it has been applied in models of diabetic retinopathy, where its antioxidant property, derived in part from upregulation of Nrf2, led to prevention of retinal neuronal degeneration (Liu et al., 2020, pp. 5–6, 7–8). While no registered clinical trials have directly explored its efficacy in dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) according to the available Clinical Trials Search (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), the biomolecular rationale derived from its cardiovascular and diabetic retinopathy studies provides an impetus for its repurposing. Its historic use in the cardiovascular arena, a field with extensive clinical validation, is now steering investigations into ocular applications, particularly those characterized by high oxidative stress and lipid dysregulation such as dry AMD (Cai et al., 2021, pp. 1–2, 12–14).

Mechanism of Action:
Probucol’s mechanism of action is multifaceted and operates primarily through its antioxidant and lipid-lowering capacities. One central mechanism involves modulation of the Keap1-Nrf2-ARE antioxidant pathway. Under oxidative stress conditions, the transcription factor Nrf2 normally dissociates from its cytoplasmic inhibitor Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) and translocates to the nucleus where it activates the transcription of a host of cytoprotective, phase II detoxifying enzymes (Cai et al., 2021, pp. 6–8). Probucol has been shown in experimental models to facilitate the dissociation of the Keap1-Nrf2 complex, thereby preventing Nrf2 degradation. The subsequent increase in nuclear Nrf2 levels results in the upregulation of antioxidant enzymes such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and enzymes involved in glutathione metabolism (Cai et al., 2021, pp. 8–9). These enzymes play essential roles in neutralizing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and protecting cells from oxidative stress.

In addition to its effects on antioxidant pathways, probucol exerts significant lipid-lowering actions by enhancing low-density lipoprotein catabolism and reducing the oxidative modification of lipids. This dual activity is especially relevant to retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells in the context of dry AMD. The RPE is exposed to a high concentration of polyunsaturated lipids and is subject to extensive oxidative stress due to constant phagocytic activity—the daily processing of photoreceptor outer segments. Excessive lipid peroxidation in RPE cells destabilizes lysosomal membranes and impairs the phagolysosomal degradation process (Cai et al., 2021, pp. 5–6; Wang et al., 2020, p. 7). Probucol’s lipid-modulating effects could reduce accumulation of oxidative lipid byproducts thereby preserving lysosomal integrity.

Furthermore, by reducing ROS levels and stabilizing the intracellular redox state, probucol may indirectly promote proper lysosomal function. This is significant because lysosomal stabilization in RPE cells is critical for efficient degradation of photoreceptor outer segments; failure in this process contributes to the accumulation of toxic debris, lipofuscin formation, and ultimately cellular dysfunction, all central to the pathogenesis of dry AMD (Cai et al., 2021, p. 14; Moekotte et al., 2024, pp. 19–24). In summary, on a molecular level, probucol’s interactions with the Keap1-Nrf2 system, combined with its capacity to lower lipid peroxidation, support its potential role in reducing oxidative damage, stabilizing lysosomal membranes, and promoting phagolysosomal degradation in RPE cells.

Expected Effect:
Based on the established mechanisms, the expected effect of probucol in assays relevant to dry AMD would be the mitigation of oxidative stress in RPE cells. This includes the reduction of intracellular ROS and lipid peroxidation, as well as the stabilization of lysosomal membranes leading to improved phagolysosomal function. Biochemically, an upregulation of Nrf2 and its downstream antioxidant targets should be observable in probucol-treated RPE cells (Cai et al., 2021, pp. 6–8). Such an effect could be validated by measuring increases in HO-1, NQO1, and glutathione-related enzymes in cell culture systems that simulate oxidative stress conditions akin to those in dry AMD.

In addition, since RPE cells express proteins critical for phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments, such as the CD36 receptor and components involved in the degradative lysosomal system, improved lysosomal activity can be monitored using assays that assess phagolysosomal degradation efficiency. Probucol is expected to enhance this degradation process by protecting lysosomal membranes from oxidative impairment and supporting the autophagic flux necessary for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis (Cai et al., 2021, pp. 1–2; Zhou et al., 2023, pp. 9–10; Wang et al., 2020, p. 7). Clinical observations in related models, such as diabetic retinopathy, have shown probucol to reduce apoptosis and ROS generation, effects that could translate into benefits for dry AMD pathology. Thus, in a well-designed preclinical assay, one would expect to see decreased markers of oxidative damage and improved clearance of photoreceptor debris in RPE cells with probucol treatment, aligning with the proposed protective mechanism in dry AMD.

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, probucol presents as a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in the treatment of dry age-related macular degeneration based on its dual functions as an antioxidant and lipid-lowering agent. A major strength of probucol is its established safety profile from decades of clinical use in cardiovascular disease, which bodes well for its translational potential in new indications. Its ability to modulate the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway and upregulate endogenous antioxidant defenses addresses the central mechanistic underpinning of retinal oxidative stress seen in dry AMD (Cai et al., 2021, pp. 6–8; Liu et al., 2020, pp. 5–6). Moreover, the lipid-lowering properties of probucol may ameliorate the deleterious accumulation of oxidized lipids within RPE cells and contribute to the stabilization of lysosomal membranes—both critical for maintaining proper phagolysosomal degradation of photoreceptor outer segments (Cai et al., 2021, pp. 8–9; Moekotte et al., 2024, pp. 19–24).

However, there are several weaknesses that must be carefully considered. Most notably, while preclinical and biochemical studies in related retinal models support the antioxidative and cytoprotective actions of probucol, direct evidence from preclinical models or clinical trials specifically targeting dry AMD is currently lacking (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). The absence of direct published data in dry AMD necessitates further rigorous investigation in appropriate animal models that closely mimic the human condition of dry AMD, particularly focusing on RPE phagolysosomal function and photoreceptor outer segment clearance. Additionally, as probucol is known to have poor oral bioavailability (<10%) and is highly lipophilic, formulation challenges must be addressed to ensure sufficient drug levels reach retinal tissues. Novel drug delivery approaches, such as nano- or micro-encapsulation strategies, may be required to overcome these pharmacokinetic limitations and ensure targeted delivery to the retina (Cai et al., 2021, pp. 8–9).

Another potential concern is the complexity of dry AMD pathogenesis, which involves not only oxidative stress and lipid dysregulation, but also inflammatory pathways, choroidal blood flow alterations, and genetic predispositions. Therefore, while probucol is mechanistically sound in targeting oxidative stress and lipid metabolism, its efficacy in the multifactorial context of dry AMD remains to be conclusively determined. It is also important to note that past studies, such as those conducted in diabetic retinopathy models, while supportive of probucol’s antioxidant potential, have primarily focused on neuronal protection rather than the specific pathology of dry AMD, which involves distinctive alterations in RPE lysosomal function (Liu et al., 2020, pp. 7–8; Cai et al., 2021, p. 14).

In conclusion, the overall evaluation of probucol for the treatment of dry AMD is cautiously optimistic. Its favorable safety profile, established mechanism of action via enhancement of the Keap1-Nrf2 antioxidant pathway, and lipid-lowering properties provide a strong biochemical and mechanistic rationale for its repurposing. However, critical gaps in direct clinical or preclinical evidence in the AMD context mandate further focused research. Necessary steps include detailed in vitro assays using RPE cell lines to assess lysosomal stability and phagolysosomal degradation, followed by comprehensive in vivo studies in relevant animal models of dry AMD to assess retinal structural and functional outcomes. Addressing formulation challenges due to poor oral bioavailability will also be crucial for successful translation into clinical use. With these additional studies, probucol could represent a valuable therapeutic candidate that targets key pathogenic factors of dry AMD, such as oxidative stress, lipid dysregulation, and impaired RPE degradation capability (Cai et al., 2021, pp. 1–2; Zhou et al., 2023, pp. 9–10; Wang et al., 2020, p. 7).

Below is a comprehensive evaluation of plerixafor (AMD3100) as a repurposed candidate for dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD), with detailed discussion of its origins, history of use, molecular mechanism, expected effects when applied to retinal pathology, and overall strengths and challenges for further development. The review is based solely on the provided context and literature keys.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate
Plerixafor, also recognized by its alternative designation AMD3100, is a small‐molecule bicyclam compound originally discovered and synthesized for its ability to antagonize the CXCR4 receptor (Dembowsky et al., 2011, pp. 7–9). Its chemical structure is based on a cyclic bicyclam core that was originally developed in the context of HIV research due to its capacity to block CXCR4—an essential co‐receptor used by HIV for cellular entry. The synthetic origin of plerixafor involved modification of the bicyclam skeleton to enhance receptor selectivity and improve pharmacokinetic properties. As a member of the CXCR4 antagonist family, plerixafor falls within a group of therapeutic agents that target G protein–coupled receptors involved in chemotactic signaling. Over time, while its early discovery was for viral entry prevention, subsequent investigations revealed that by blocking the interaction between the chemokine stromal cell–derived factor-1 (SDF-1, also known as CXCL12) and its receptor CXCR4, plerixafor can actively mobilize hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from the bone marrow compartment into peripheral blood (Dembowsky et al., 2011, pp. 7–9; Domingues et al., 2017, pp. 1–3). This discovery redirected its clinical utility toward the field of hematologic transplantation, where rapid and efficient mobilization of CD34+ cells became a critical need. Moreover, the CXCR4/SDF-1 axis is now recognized as a key regulator not only of stem cell retention and mobilization but also of inflammatory cell trafficking and tissue repair responses. In so doing, plerixafor represents a therapeutic “tool‐kit” member whose potential implications extend well beyond its initial antiviral application. Its classification as a CXCR4 antagonist has led investigators to examine its possible role in diseases with underlying inflammatory or degenerative components, such as dry AMD, where dysregulation of immune cell recruitment may contribute to retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) dysfunction (Dembowsky et al., 2011, pp. 7–9; Domingues et al., 2017, pp. 1–3).

Therapeutic History
Plerixafor has a robust history in clinical settings, particularly in the hematology domain. Clinically, it has been widely used for its ability to mobilize CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells in patients suffering from multiple myeloma or non‐Hodgkin’s lymphoma, conditions where adequate stem cell yield is critical for effective autologous transplantation (Childs, 2004; Genzyme, a Sanofi Company, 2006). In these instances, plerixafor is typically administered by subcutaneous injection, and its efficacy has been validated by extensive clinical trials that provided comprehensive data on its pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and safety profiles. These studies have consistently confirmed that the CXCR4/SDF-1 interaction is effectively disrupted by plerixafor, leading to rapid mobilization of progenitor cells from the bone marrow niche into circulation (Dembowsky et al., 2011, pp. 7–9).

In the broader therapeutic landscape, beyond its hematopoietic applications, investigators have started to explore the potential implications of inhibiting CXCR4 in models of inflammatory tissue injury and neovascular formation. For example, several preclinical studies using laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV) models, which are primarily utilized to study wet AMD, have demonstrated that CXCR4 antagonism can reduce inflammatory cell infiltration and pathological vascular leakage (Lee & Rewolinski, 2010, pp. 1–2; Omori et al., 2018, p. 10). Although these studies focus primarily on acute inflammatory responses in the retina, they provide useful insights into the potential for modulating cell migration through the CXCR4/SDF-1 axis. Over the past few years, there have been increasing efforts to assess the role of CXCR4 inhibition in ocular pathologies – including investigating microglial recruitment and RPE health – though robust clinical trials examining plerixafor directly for dry AMD are lacking (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Tsou et al., 2018, pp. 9–10). Moreover, while plerixafor’s clinical use outside oncology is limited, the rich safety data and PK/PD profiles established in the hematologic context serve as major advantages when considering repurposing efforts for chronic retinal degenerative conditions such as dry AMD.

Mechanism of Action
At the molecular level, plerixafor functions as a selective antagonist of the CXCR4 receptor. Under normal physiological conditions, the SDF-1/CXCR4 interaction plays a pivotal role in maintaining the “homing” and retention of stem cells in the bone marrow as well as in regulating chemotactic responses in various cell types. Plerixafor binds to specific aspartic acid residues located on CXCR4, thereby competitively inhibiting the binding of SDF-1 (Dembowsky et al., 2011, pp. 27–29). This binding disrupts downstream signal transduction cascades that are typically activated by the receptor–ligand interaction. Key intracellular pathways such as PI3K/Akt and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade (including ERK) are normally activated by SDF-1 engagement with CXCR4, promoting cell survival, proliferation, and chemotaxis (Tsou et al., 2018, pp. 32–34). By interrupting these signals, plerixafor not only mobilizes HSPCs by liberating them from bone marrow retention signals but also limits the invasion and accumulation of inflammatory cells in peripheral tissues.

In the context of ocular pathology, particularly in models of retinal injury and degeneration, elevated levels of SDF-1 have been reported under stress conditions. Retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells – which are crucial for photoreceptor support and debris clearance – as well as resident microglia have been shown to express CXCR4 when challenged by injury, inflammation, or stress (Omori et al., 2018, p. 10; Zhang et al., 2009, pp. 9–10). The consequent engagement of the receptor by SDF-1 leads to chemotactic recruitment of inflammatory cells, including microglia, into the retinal microenvironment. This eventual increase in inflammatory cell infiltration is thought to exacerbate local cytokine release and tissue damage. Moreover, the CXCR4/SDF-1 axis may contribute to a vicious cycle where chronic inflammation further disrupts RPE function, including their essential phagocytic clearance of photoreceptor outer segments.

Thus, when plerixafor is applied in such settings, its antagonism of CXCR4 is hypothesized to reduce the chemotactic gradient recognized by inflammatory cells. By blocking SDF-1 from binding to CXCR4, plerixafor is expected to limit the recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells and microglia in the retina. The reduction in inflammatory cell infiltration should then mitigate tissue damage and create a more permissive environment for RPE cells to perform their phagocytic functions (Dembowsky et al., 2011, pp. 17–20; Tsou et al., 2018, pp. 9–10). In models where laser-induced injury mimics acute inflammatory responses, CXCR4 inhibition has resulted in attenuated vascular leakage and reduced neovascular formation, effects that may be extrapolated in part to the context of dry AMD where inflammation is chronic and less overt but cumulatively damaging (Lee & Rewolinski, 2010, pp. 1–2). Further cellular studies indicate that both RPE cells and resident microglia upregulate CXCR4 expression under pathological conditions, which supports the notion that cessation of SDF-1 signaling via plerixafor can modulate deleterious cellular crosstalk in the retina (Omori et al., 2018, p. 10; Zhang et al., 2009, pp. 9–10). It is also important to note that while inhibition of CXCR4 is intended to reduce harmful inflammation, this axis is also involved in mechanisms of tissue repair and regeneration; thus, careful consideration must be given to achieving an optimal level of inhibition that reduces pathology without unduly compromising beneficial reparative processes (Tsou et al., 2018, pp. 32–34; Unoki et al., 2010, pp. 5–7).

Expected Effect
The central hypothesis for repurposing plerixafor in dry AMD centers on its capacity to modulate the inflammatory interplay between the RPE and resident microglia. In dry AMD, chronic retinal inflammation is a significant contributor to RPE dysfunction and eventual photoreceptor loss. One of the key deficits in dry AMD is the impaired phagocytic clearance by RPE cells of shed photoreceptor outer segments—a process that, when compromised, leads to the build-up of extracellular deposits (drusen) and subsequent cell stress (Li et al., 2012, pp. 2–3). Elevated SDF-1 levels in an aged or injured retina are thought to create a chemotactic signal that recruits microglia and other inflammatory cells into the subretinal space. This influx of cells, while initially aimed at clearing debris, can become maladaptive when chronic, promoting an inflammatory milieu that further stresses the RPE (Omori et al., 2018, p. 10; Zhang et al., 2009, pp. 9–10).

In this light, plerixafor is expected to decrease the recruitment of inflammatory cells—particularly microglia—by blocking CXCR4 and thereby reducing SDF-1–induced chemotaxis. One anticipates that with fewer pro-inflammatory cells migrating into the retina, there will be a concomitant reduction in inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules (such as ICAM-1 and VCAM-1) that exacerbate tissue stress (Dembowsky et al., 2011, pp. 17–20; Tsou et al., 2018, pp. 9–10). With a lower inflammatory burden, the RPE may regain or maintain its basal phagocytic function and more effectively clear debris from photoreceptors. This is particularly critical in dry AMD, where inefficient phagocytosis contributes to the accumulation of debris and the eventual degeneration of the retinal architecture.

Preclinical evidence from models using CXCR4 antagonists shows that blockade of this receptor can reduce leukocyte infiltration in other tissues and mitigate neovascular responses in acute retinal injury models (Lee & Rewolinski, 2010, pp. 1–2; Omori et al., 2018, p. 10). Although such studies have been largely performed using acute injury models such as laser-induced CNV, the underlying principle—that CXCR4 inhibition decreases inflammatory cell migration—supports the idea that similar benefits could be achieved in chronic inflammatory settings typical of dry AMD. In addition, reports indicate that both RPE cells and microglia upregulate CXCR4 expression when under physiological stress (Omori et al., 2018, p. 10; Zhang et al., 2009, pp. 9–10). By administering plerixafor, the expectation is that the reduction in SDF-1 signaling will not only limit excessive microglial recruitment but also modulate the RPE–microglia crosstalk to favor a reparative state over a pro-inflammatory one. Ultimately, the desired effect is to restore a more homeostatic retinal environment in which RPE cells can perform effective phagocytic clearance and prevent the progression of neurodegeneration.

Furthermore, given that the subretinal accumulation of debris is a hallmark of early dry AMD, successful intervention on the CXCR4 axis might also reduce the downstream fibrotic and degenerative remodeling that characterizes the later stages of the disease. This is supported indirectly by studies showing that CXCR4 antagonists can reduce pathological fibrosis and neovascular events in models of retinal injury (Tsou et al., 2018, pp. 9–10; Dembowsky et al., 2011, pp. 17–20). Although these models are not direct analogues of dry AMD, they provide molecular proof-of-concept regarding the role of CXCR4 in mediating detrimental inflammatory and fibrotic responses.

Overall Evaluation
The repurposing of plerixafor for dry AMD is an intriguing prospect, especially considering both the strong molecular rationale and the extensive clinical data already available from its use in hematologic disorders. One of the key strengths of plerixafor is its well-established mechanism of action: by competitively inhibiting CXCR4, it disrupts the SDF-1–mediated pathways that drive both stem cell retention and inflammatory cell migration (Dembowsky et al., 2011, pp. 27–29; Tsou et al., 2018, pp. 32–34). This mechanism is directly relevant to the pathogenesis observed in dry AMD, where chronic, low-grade inflammation impairs RPE function and photoreceptor maintenance. Moreover, the vast clinical experience—documented in multiple trials such as NCT00075335 and NCT00445302—provides confidence in the safety profile, PK/PD characteristics, and overall tolerability of plerixafor (Childs, 2004; Genzyme, a Sanofi Company, 2006). Such a foundation significantly de-risks the drug development process when considering repurposing for a new indication like dry AMD.

From a biochemical standpoint, data indicate that CXCR4 plays significant roles in modulating cellular migration and inflammatory signaling in various tissues, including the retina (Omori et al., 2018, p. 10; Zhang et al., 2009, pp. 9–10). In preclinical retinal models – even those largely developed for acute injury such as laser-induced CNV – CXCR4 antagonists have demonstrated the ability to reduce not only vascular leakage but also inflammatory cell infiltration (Lee & Rewolinski, 2010, pp. 3–4). These studies serve as a proxy to suggest that similar mechanisms may be enlisted in a chronic degenerative model such as dry AMD, where inflammation underlies much of the cellular dysfunction. Additionally, given that both RPE cells and retinal microglia have been shown to upregulate CXCR4 upon stress (Omori et al., 2018, p. 10; Zhang et al., 2009, pp. 9–10), targeting this receptor may indeed improve RPE–microglia crosstalk by decreasing the sustained inflammatory probing and thereby relieving the inhibition of RPE phagocytic clearance.

Despite these promising aspects, several notable challenges remain. First, the majority of preclinical studies with CXCR4 antagonists in the ocular setting have utilized models that mimic acute injury and neovascular phenomena rather than the insidious, chronic degeneration seen in dry AMD (Lee & Rewolinski, 2010, pp. 3–4; Li et al., 2012, pp. 2–3). Dry AMD is characterized by subtle, progressive changes in the RPE, Bruch’s membrane, and photoreceptors, and the inflammatory processes, while present, are less dramatic than the responses seen in acute injury. It remains to be determined whether the level of CXCR4 inhibition achieved with plerixafor will be sufficient to reverse or even suitably slow the degeneration in a chronic disease state.

Another important consideration is the route of administration. In its current clinical indication for stem cell mobilization, plerixafor is administered systemically via subcutaneous injection. However, the retina is a privileged compartment behind the blood–retina barrier, and achieving therapeutic concentrations locally (for example, via intravitreal injection or optimized topical formulations) may be imperative to impart any beneficial effects while avoiding systemic adverse events. Formulation challenges and dosing strategies will therefore need to be carefully revisited for the ocular application of plerixafor (Domingues et al., 2017, pp. 1–3).

A further potential weakness arises from the dual role of the CXCR4/SDF-1 axis. Although chronic overactivation of this pathway is implicated in pathological inflammation, the same system is critical for normal tissue repair and immune surveillance. An indiscriminate or overly aggressive inhibition of CXCR4 may impair the physiological processes that are necessary for the retinal homeostasis and debris clearance, potentially leading to unintended consequences. For example, microglia are essential for phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments, and while excessive microglial recruitment and activation are harmful, a baseline level of activity is necessary to maintain retinal health. Balancing the need to reduce inflammatory cell infiltration while preserving necessary homeostatic functions will be crucial (Tsou et al., 2018, pp. 32–34; Unoki et al., 2010, pp. 5–7).

Finally, although the hypothesis that plerixafor might improve RPE phagocytic clearance by modulating RPE–microglia crosstalk is biologically plausible, direct preclinical studies that assess this specific outcome in models of dry AMD are limited. Most of the current evidence is inferred from studies investigating acute inflammatory responses (Omori et al., 2018, p. 10; Zhang et al., 2009, pp. 9–10) and from insights into the general behavior of the CXCR4/SDF-1 signaling system in tissue injury and repair. As such, it would be necessary to design further investigations using chronic models that better replicate dry AMD pathology to rigorously test this hypothesis (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Li et al., 2012, pp. 2–3).

In summary, the overall assessment of plerixafor as a therapeutic candidate for repurposing in dry AMD is cautiously optimistic. Its strengths lie in its well-defined mechanism of antagonizing CXCR4, the vast clinical data attesting to its safety profile and efficacy in mobilizing stem cells, and the biochemical rationale that suggests inhibition of the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis could disrupt pathological inflammatory cell recruitment in the retina (Dembowsky et al., 2011, pp. 17–20; Omori et al., 2018, p. 10; Tsou et al., 2018, pp. 9–10). These factors provide a strong foundation for the hypothesis that plerixafor could help restore a more homeostatic environment in chronic retinal degeneration by improving RPE function and reducing deleterious inflammation.

On the other hand, the challenges include the absence of direct preclinical evidence in chronic models of dry AMD, the inherent difficulties of achieving optimal local drug delivery to the retina, and the possibility that chronic CXCR4 inhibition might negatively impact necessary reparative processes in the eye (Lee & Rewolinski, 2010, pp. 3–4; Li et al., 2012, pp. 2–3). In addition, balancing the suppression of harmful inflammation while preserving normal microglial phagocytic roles remains a delicate task that requires further empirical validation.

Moving forward, it will be critical to design experiments using chronic, progressive models of dry AMD that more faithfully recapitulate human pathology. These studies should evaluate the effects of locally delivered plerixafor (or its appropriately formulated derivatives) on inflammatory cell recruitment, cytokine and adhesion molecule expression, RPE phagocytic function, and overall retinal integrity. Only with such targeted investigations can we begin to assess whether the beneficial effects observed in acute and neovascular models can be translated into meaningful therapeutic outcomes for patients with dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

In conclusion, while plerixafor’s established clinical use, well-defined mechanism, and promising preclinical data in related ocular inflammatory models make it an attractive candidate for repurposing in dry AMD, significant additional work is required to move this hypothesis from theory into practice. Overall, plerixafor represents a promising, albeit unproven, candidate for modulating the CXCR4/SDF-1 axis in the retina, with potential to dampen maladaptive inflammation, improve RPE function, and thus slow the degenerative progression of dry AMD (Dembowsky et al., 2011, pp. 17–20; Omori et al., 2018, p. 10; Tsou et al., 2018, pp. 9–10).

"Magrolimab (Hu5F9-G4, clinical grade antibody)","Proposal for Magrolimab (Hu5F9-G4, clinical grade antibody)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Magrolimab (Hu5F9-G4) is a humanized monoclonal antibody originally developed to target CD47, a ubiquitously expressed transmembrane protein that functions as a “don’t eat me” signal. As a member of the immuno‐oncology class of therapeutics, it was discovered using platforms that focus on generating high‐affinity antibodies against antigens overexpressed by tumor cells, thereby enabling the immune system—primarily macrophages and dendritic cells—to recognize and phagocytose cancer cells that would otherwise evade clearance by expressing high levels of CD47 (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). This class of compounds has been extensively used in oncology, where agents targeting the CD47–SIRPα axis have shown promise in promoting the phagocytosis of malignant cells by blocking inhibitory signals; thus, the mechanism has been proven effective in reactivating innate immune clearance pathways in a variety of cancers (Bouwstra et al., 2022, pp. 5–6).

Therapeutic History:
Magrolimab has undergone significant clinical evaluation in hematologic malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Clinical trials have demonstrated that when administered with appropriate priming regimens to mitigate on‐target anemia and other off‐tumor effects, it can effectively promote the clearance of tumor cells via macrophage activation (Qu et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Sheng et al., 2024, pp. 6–8). To date, its use has been predominantly in oncology; however, emerging research in ocular and retinal biology has drawn parallels between the mechanisms driving tumor immune evasion and those that may underlie subretinal debris accumulation in dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Preclinical studies investigating the role of CD47 in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and photoreceptor homeostasis indicate that loss of CD47 expression or its blockade leads to enhanced phagocytosis—manifesting as the formation of melanophages and hyperreflective foci, both recognized as biomarkers for AMD progression (Augustin et al., 2023, pp. 1–2; Augustin et al., 2023, pp. 12–14). While these findings have not yet translated into direct clinical use of magrolimab for dry AMD, the precedent set by its oncological applications provides a valuable safety and mechanistic framework for considering its repurposing in this context.

Mechanism of Action:
Under normal circumstances, CD47 on RPE cells and photoreceptor debris binds to signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPα) on phagocytic cells, delivering an inhibitory “don’t eat me” signal that restricts engulfment. Magrolimab binds to CD47 with high affinity, thereby preventing its interaction with SIRPα and releasing the brake on phagocytosis (Wang et al., 2021, pp. 6–7). In oncology, this blockade leads to the activation of macrophage-mediated clearance of tumor cells, and preclinical retinal studies have shown that similar CD47 blockade can enhance the phagocytic removal of RPE-derived pigment and cellular debris (Augustin et al., 2023, pp. 12–14). The biochemical cascade initiated by CD47 blockade involves the elimination of inhibitory signals mediated through SIRPα’s intracellular immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs), which, when phosphorylated, dampen the phagocytic response. By preventing this phosphorylation cascade, magrolimab essentially “releases” the phagocytes, enabling them to clear debris even in the absence of additional “eat me” signals (Wang et al., 2021, pp. 10–11; Qu et al., 2022, pp. 1–2). It is important to note that while studies in retinal degeneration models—such as those conducted in Cd47‐deficient mice—demonstrate that loss of CD47 leads to the formation of melanophages and correlates with disease progression, the working hypothesis here is that controlled blockade of CD47 in a therapeutic window could improve the removal of subretinal deposits without precipitating further RPE damage (Augustin et al., 2023, pp. 15–17).

Expected Effect:
The central goal of repurposing magrolimab for dry AMD is to promote the efficient clearance of pathogenic subretinal deposits by modulating phagocytosis. In the context of dry AMD, accumulation of drusen and subretinal debris is a key pathological hallmark that contributes to chronic inflammation and RPE dysfunction. By interrupting the CD47–SIRPα interaction, magrolimab is expected to enhance the phagocytic activity of retinal macrophages and, possibly, RPE cells themselves, which have been shown to undertake phagocytosis in the healthy retina during outer segment renewal (Augustin et al., 2023, pp. 4–5; Beguier, 2018, pp. 137–138). The underlying hypothesis is that without the “don’t eat me” signal, these phagocytes will clear debris more effectively, leading to a reduction in hyperreflective foci and the overall burden of subretinal deposits—a mechanism that aligns with the therapeutic objectives for stopping or reversing the progression of dry AMD. Additionally, the molecular targets of magrolimab are expressed in relevant ocular cell types; CD47 is present on RPE cells and photoreceptors, and its decline with age or in AMD has been documented, which further supports the rationale for targeting this pathway (Augustin et al., 2023, pp. 14–15; Wang et al., 2021, pp. 6–7). There is also evidence from related studies showing that augmentation of CD47/SIRPα signaling can protect cones from degeneration by modulating immune cell activity (Wang et al., 2021, pp. 6–7), although this suggests that the exact timing and extent of CD47 modulation is critical; thus, the desired therapeutic modulation might aim for a balanced blockade that enhances clearance without promoting excess phagocytosis of viable cells.

Overall Evaluation:
Magrolimab represents a promising candidate for repurposing in dry AMD based on its well‐established mechanism of action in oncology and emerging preclinical data supporting the role of the CD47–SIRPα axis in regulating retinal debris clearance. One of the major strengths of magrolimab is its clinical pedigree and the extensive safety data available from oncological trials, where the antibody has demonstrated manageable side effects with the use of priming dose strategies (Qu et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Sheng et al., 2024, pp. 6–8). This wealth of clinical experience should facilitate the translation of the drug into ocular studies. Furthermore, the mechanistic rationale is robust, as the inhibition of the “don’t eat me” signal has been shown to promote phagocytosis in multiple experimental systems; in the retina, preclinical models indicate that reduced CD47 expression correlates with increased formation of melanophages and progression of AMD, suggesting that a controlled blockade may instead improve debris clearance (Augustin et al., 2023, pp. 1–2; Augustin et al., 2023, pp. 15–17).

However, several challenges and weaknesses must be carefully considered. First, the retinal context differs significantly from the tumor microenvironment, and the balance between beneficial debris clearance and harmful over-phagocytosis of healthy RPE cells is delicate. Some preclinical findings indicate that loss of CD47 on RPE cells can precipitate pathological clearance leading to RPE dysmorphia—a phenomenon that is thought to contribute to AMD progression (Augustin et al., 2023, pp. 14–15). Thus, dosing regimens, timing of administration, and drug delivery methods will be critical to avoid exacerbating retinal degeneration. Second, although magrolimab’s safety profile is documented in oncology, systemic administration may cause off‐target effects such as anemia, given the widespread expression of CD47 on red blood cells; local ocular delivery strategies might mitigate these risks, but such approaches require further development and validation (Bouwstra et al., 2022, pp. 5–6; Sheng et al., 2024, pp. 6–8). Third, there remains an unresolved issue regarding whether microglia/macrophage‐mediated clearance in the retina can function in a truly SIRPα‐independent manner or whether modulation of CD47 signaling inadvertently affects other immune‐regulatory circuits in the eye (Wang et al., 2021, pp. 10–11). Finally, while the overall biochemical and molecular rationale is supportive, direct preclinical studies in dry AMD models using magrolimab (or similar CD47 blockers) remain limited. Thus, additional in vivo studies in appropriate animal models of dry AMD are essential to fully ascertain the therapeutic window, efficacy, and potential adverse effects.

In summary, magrolimab—as an anti‐CD47 monoclonal antibody—has a compelling mechanistic basis for repurposing in dry AMD. It belongs to a proven class of immunotherapeutics that function by blocking a key phagocytosis checkpoint and has demonstrated clear efficacy in promoting cell clearance in cancer. Preclinical retinal studies have established an association between reduced CD47 signaling and enhanced formation of melanophages and subretinal debris accumulation, which has driven the hypothesis that careful inhibition of CD47 could instead foster efficient clearance of such deposits (Augustin et al., 2023, pp. 12–14; Augustin et al., 2023, pp. 15–17). Strengths of the candidate include its established clinical history in oncology, a well‐elucidated mechanism of action, and a strong biological rationale based on CD47 expression in the retina. Conversely, the challenges lie in precisely titrating the blockade to encourage clearance of debris without triggering excessive phagocytosis that could damage healthy RPE cells, as well as mitigating systemic side effects inherent to CD47‐targeting agents. Further preclinical studies using ocular‐specific delivery methods and refined dosing strategies will be necessary before initiating human trials in dry AMD. Overall, while promising, magrolimab’s translation to ocular indications will require significant validation to ensure that the benefits of enhanced debris clearance outweigh the risks of overactive phagocytosis in the delicate retinal environment (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Augustin et al., 2023, pp. 1–2; Wang et al., 2021, pp. 6–7).

"Mdivi-1 (catalog M0199, Sigma-Aldrich)","Proposal for Mdivi-1 (catalog M0199, Sigma-Aldrich)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Mdivi‐1 is a small‐molecule compound originally discovered as a mitochondrial division inhibitor that targets the enzymatic activity of dynamin‐related protein 1 (Drp1) (Smith & Gallo, 2017). It belongs to the class of compounds that modulate mitochondrial dynamics by reducing excessive fission, thereby preserving or restoring the mitochondrial network integrity. Mdivi‐1 (catalog M0199, Sigma‐Aldrich) is a synthetic small molecule that was first identified through chemical screening aimed at finding inhibitors of mitochondrial division in yeast, and then later applied to mammalian cells, particularly in contexts where mitochondrial fragmentation is pathogenic (Bordt et al., 2017; Manczak et al., 2019). As a mitochondrial division inhibitor, it falls within a broader class of mitochondrial‐targeted therapeutic candidates that have been investigated in neurodegenerative and ischemic disease models, where the maintenance of mitochondrial network integrity is critical for cell survival. The synthetic origins of Mdivi‐1 are rooted in medicinal chemistry efforts to identify quinazolinone derivatives that can specifically interfere with the fission machinery, and it has since been repurposed for investigations in other degenerative disorders such as retinal degeneration, based on its biochemical mechanism (Smith & Gallo, 2017).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, Mdivi‐1 has been extensively studied in preclinical research primarily for its neuroprotective effects in models of brain ischemia, traumatic brain injury, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and Huntington’s disease (Bordt et al., 2017; Manczak et al., 2019). Its mechanism as an inhibitor of Drp1 was originally thought to stem from a direct inhibition of the Drp1 GTPase activity, although subsequent studies revealed that some of its cellular effects may also involve reversible inhibition of mitochondrial complex I and modulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (Bordt et al., 2017; Manczak et al., 2019). In terms of translational research, although Mdivi‐1 has been widely used in over a hundred preclinical studies addressing mitochondrial dysfunction, its application in ocular diseases has been more limited. A search of ClinicalTrials.gov for terms including “Mdivi‐1”, “DRP1 inhibitor”, or “mitochondrial division inhibitor” in conjunction with “age‐related macular degeneration”, “retinal degeneration”, “retina”, or “RPE” identified clinical trials that indicate clinical interest in mitochondrial‐targeted strategies for retinal diseases (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). While direct clinical studies using Mdivi‐1 for treating dry AMD have not been reported, its promising effects in models of neurodegeneration and other forms of retinal injury, such as those observed in radiation‐induced optic neuropathy that affect retinal ganglion cells (Rong et al., 2020), provide a rationale for its repurposing in dry AMD. Furthermore, studies in non‐ocular cellular models, especially in neuronal N2a cells, demonstrate that treatment with Mdivi‐1 results in a decrease in mitochondrial fragmentation and an improvement in mitochondrial bioenergetics, outcomes that could translate to retinal cell preservation (Manczak et al., 2019).

Mechanism of Action:
The primary mechanism of action of Mdivi‐1 is its inhibition of Drp1, a dynamin‐related GTPase that orchestrates mitochondrial fission (Manczak et al., 2019; Smith & Gallo, 2017). Drp1 translocates to the outer mitochondrial membrane where it oligomerizes into ring‐like structures that constrict the membrane to facilitate fission. Under conditions of oxidative stress and in various degenerative pathologies, dysregulated Drp1 activity leads to excessive mitochondrial fission, fragmentation, and subsequent mitochondrial dysfunction. Mdivi‐1 inhibits Drp1’s enzymatic GTPase activity, reducing its ability to oligomerize and drive fission, which in turn promotes a shift towards mitochondrial fusion (Manczak et al., 2019). In several studies, treatment with Mdivi‐1 has resulted in a decrease in mRNA and protein levels of mitochondrial fission markers such as Drp1 and Fis1, while simultaneously increasing the expression of mitochondrial fusion regulators such as Mfn1, Mfn2, and Opa1 (Manczak et al., 2019). Additionally, Mdivi‐1 has been shown to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis, evidenced by upregulation of markers such as PGC‐1α, NRF1, NRF2, and TFAM (Kaarniranta et al., 2018; Manczak et al., 2019). There is also evidence from biochemical studies that at lower concentrations (around 25 µM), Mdivi‐1 improves the activity of mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) complexes (complexes I, II, and IV) and enhances mitochondrial respiration, while higher doses (75 µM) can be toxic, reducing ATP production and increasing oxidative markers (Manczak et al., 2019). Moreover, some studies have suggested that additional beneficial effects of Mdivi‐1 might be mediated by its capacity to modulate complex I–dependent respiration and reduce ROS production through interference with reverse electron transport (Bordt et al., 2017; Ruiz et al., 2018). This multi‐faceted mechanism not only helps to preserve mitochondrial network integrity but also appears to enhance mitochondrial quality control through promotion of mitophagy and overall bioenergetics, which are critical for the survival and proper function of energy‐demanding cells (Kaarniranta et al., 2019).

Expected Effect:
In the context of dry age‐related macular degeneration (dry AMD), the hypothesis is that Mdivi‐1 will preserve mitochondrial network integrity in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells. Given that mitochondrial dysfunction, excessive ROS production, and impaired autophagy contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of dry AMD, the expected effect of Mdivi‐1 involves several interrelated outcomes. Firstly, by inhibiting Drp1‐dependent mitochondrial fission, Mdivi‐1 should reduce aberrant mitochondrial fragmentation in RPE cells, thereby preserving mitochondrial morphology and function (Kaarniranta et al., 2018; Manczak et al., 2019). This preservation is critical because RPE cells rely on a robust mitochondrial network for the energy requirements associated with the phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments—a process that, when impaired, contributes to dry AMD pathology (Kaarniranta et al., 2018). Secondly, the reduction in mitochondrial fragmentation is expected to lower the production of mitochondrial ROS, reducing oxidative stress and subsequent cellular senescence in RPE cells (Manczak et al., 2019; Ruiz et al., 2018). Thirdly, the pharmacological action of Mdivi‐1 may enhance bioenergetics by improving the function of ETC complexes, leading to increased mitochondrial ATP production at optimal dosages, which supports both normal cellular metabolism and energy‐demanding processes such as autophagy (Manczak et al., 2019). Finally, by stabilizing mitochondrial dynamics, Mdivi‐1 may facilitate autophagy‐dependent phagocytic clearance of damaged photoreceptor outer segments by RPE cells, potentially reducing the accumulation of lipofuscin and other oxidative byproducts that are hallmarks of dry AMD (Kaarniranta et al., 2019; Cueva‐Vargas et al., 2025). In summary, the expected therapeutic effect of Mdivi‐1 in the proposed assay is to preserve RPE function by enhancing mitochondrial quality control, reducing oxidative stress, and supporting the phagocytosis mechanism necessary for retinal homeostasis—all of which could contribute to slowing the progression of dry AMD (Hyttinen et al., 2018).

Overall Evaluation:
Based on the comprehensive literature review, Mdivi‐1 emerges as a promising candidate for repurposing as a therapeutic for dry AMD, primarily through its impact on mitochondrial dynamics. The compound’s strengths include a well‐characterized mechanism targeting Drp1, which is central to the regulation of mitochondrial fission (Manczak et al., 2019). In several preclinical models—though mostly neuronal or non‐retinal—the benefits of Mdivi‐1 in preserving mitochondrial network integrity, reducing excessive ROS production, and enhancing bioenergetics have been clearly demonstrated (Manczak et al., 2019). These properties are highly relevant to RPE cells, which require efficient mitochondrial function for the energy‐intensive process of phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments and for maintaining retinal health (Kaarniranta et al., 2018; Kaarniranta et al., 2019). The proposed mechanism of action aligns with the current understanding that mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are crucial drivers of dry AMD, and interventions that restore mitochondrial homeostasis could be beneficial (Hyttinen et al., 2018).

However, there are several weaknesses and gaps that remain. First, most of the direct biochemical evidence for Mdivi‐1 comes from studies in neuronal cell lines (e.g., N2a cells) rather than in RPE cells or directly in models of retinal degeneration (Manczak et al., 2019). This raises questions regarding the translational potential of these findings to ocular tissues. Although the underlying mitochondrial pathways are conserved across cell types, the unique metabolic environment and phagocytic requirements of the RPE necessitate dedicated studies. Second, there is a narrow therapeutic window for Mdivi‐1, with evidence showing that higher concentrations (e.g., 75 µM) can lead to toxicity, including decreases in ETC activity and ATP production (Manczak et al., 2019). This necessitates careful dosing and further pharmacokinetic studies to ensure safety, especially for chronic treatment in conditions like dry AMD. Third, while related clinical trials and preclinical studies underscore the potential of targeting mitochondrial dysfunction in retinal diseases, direct clinical evidence for the use of Mdivi‐1 specifically in dry AMD is lacking (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Kaarniranta et al., 2018). Additionally, some controversy exists regarding the specificity of Mdivi‐1’s mechanism of action—for instance, whether its protective effects are solely due to inhibition of Drp1 or also involve off‐target modulation of complex I–dependent respiration and ROS production (Bordt et al., 2017; Smith & Gallo, 2017). This uncertainty underlines the need for further mechanistic studies in retinal cell models.

Despite these limitations, the overall evaluation suggests that Mdivi‐1 has notable potential as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry AMD due to its capacity to restore mitochondrial quality control. Its strengths lie in the molecular rationale that preserving mitochondrial integrity could mitigate oxidative stress, enhance bioenergetics, and support the autophagy‐dependent clearance of damaged outer segments in RPE cells—processes that are fundamentally disrupted in dry AMD (Kaarniranta et al., 2018; Manczak et al., 2019). The fact that Mdivi‐1 has been previously used in numerous preclinical studies and has known dosing profiles in rodent models adds to its appeal for further testing and translational research (Manczak et al., 2019; Hyttinen et al., 2018). However, before progressing to clinical trials for dry AMD, it will be necessary to perform targeted preclinical studies in RPE‐specific and retinal degeneration models to assess not only efficacy but also the long‐term safety and appropriate dosing regimens of Mdivi‐1 in ocular tissues (Kaarniranta et al., 2019; Manczak et al., 2019).

In conclusion, Mdivi‐1 offers a promising strategy to address the mitochondrial dysfunction implicated in dry AMD. Its ability to inhibit Drp1‐mediated mitochondrial fission, reduce oxidative damage, and promote mitochondrial biogenesis aligns well with the therapeutic needs of maintaining RPE cell function and photoreceptor health. While preclinical evidence from neuronal and other cellular models provides a strong mechanistic foundation, additional studies focusing on retinal cells and in vivo AMD models are required to fully validate its viability as a treatment for dry AMD. Overall, the balance of evidence supports further investment in Mdivi‐1 as a repurposed drug candidate for dry AMD, with particular attention to optimizing dosage to maximize efficacy while minimizing potential mitochondrial toxicity (Manczak et al., 2019; Kaarniranta et al., 2018; Rong et al., 2020).
