Query: Compile methodologies for quantifying complement activation and inflammasome signaling in retinal pigment epithelium cell cultures, including detection of C3a/C5a anaphylatoxins, membrane attack complex deposition, caspase-1 enzymatic assays, and IL-1β/IL-18 cytokine release measurements

Answer:
Quantification of complement activation and inflammasome signaling in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cell cultures relies on a combination of molecular, immunochemical, and functional assays that provide both qualitative and quantitative readouts. First, to detect complement activation through the assessment of anaphylatoxins such as C3a and C5a, investigators employ immunoassays that allow for specific quantification of these soluble fragments. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and multiplex bead‐based assays are the primary techniques, as they can discriminate low abundance proteins in culture supernatants while maintaining sensitivity and specificity. In practice, conditioned media from RPE cells—often following serum treatment with complement‐competent human serum or following complement activation via recombinant C5a—are collected, and the levels of C3a and C5a are quantified using commercially validated kits (Fernandezgodino2015alocalcomplement pages 10-11, Linetsky20184hydroxy7oxo5heptenoicacidlactone pages 3-5).

For detection of the membrane attack complex (MAC) deposition on RPE cell membranes, immunofluorescence (IF) or immunohistochemistry (IHC) techniques are implemented using antibodies targeting specific MAC components such as C5b-9. These methods involve fixing the cells (or tissue sections) under conditions that preserve membrane integrity and then probing with antibodies that bind to MAC deposits, thereby providing a visual and quantitative localization of complement activation on the cell surface. Although not all studies detailed these assays explicitly, the detection of MAC deposition using IF/IHC is a well-established method in the field (Linetsky20184hydroxy7oxo5heptenoicacidlactone pages 3-5, Mohlin2018amodelto pages 2-3).

Inflammasome activation is commonly evaluated by measuring caspase-1 enzymatic activity, as this protease is a key effector in the maturation of inflammatory cytokines. Typically, caspase-1 activity is quantified through fluorometric or luminescent assays, where cell lysates are incubated with a caspase-1 specific substrate that releases a fluorescent or luminescent signal upon cleavage. In parallel, inhibitor studies using the caspase-1 inhibitor Z-YVAD-FMK inform on the specificity of the enzymatic activity, further confirming the role of caspase-1 in the inflammasome complex. This approach is often complemented by Western blot analysis of caspase-1 cleavage products, validating the findings from the enzymatic assays (Brandstetter2015complementcomponentc5a pages 2-3, Busch2017anaphylatoxinsactivateca2+ pages 3-4).

Finally, the cytokine release measurements of IL-1β and IL-18 are critical functional readouts for inflammasome activation. These cytokines, once processed by caspase-1, are secreted into the culture medium. Their levels can be measured using ELISAs tailored for these interleukins, or alternatively by multiplex bead-based immunoassays that allow simultaneous quantification of several cytokines. The choice of the assay depends on the desired throughput and the need to measure additional cytokines concurrently. Cytokine quantification not only confirms inflammasome activation but also provides insights into the downstream inflammatory response elicited by complement signaling and cellular stress (Brandstetter2015complementcomponentc5a pages 3-5, Busch2017anaphylatoxinsactivateca2+ pages 3-4).

In summary, a comprehensive evaluation of complement activation and inflammasome signaling in RPE cultures involves: (1) ELISA and multiplex assays for soluble complement components (C3a/C5a) in culture media; (2) immunofluorescence or immunohistochemical detection of MAC deposition on cell membranes; (3) quantitative assays for caspase-1 enzymatic activity using fluorometric or luminescent substrates, often alongside inhibitor treatments; and (4) cytokine release measurements of IL-1β and IL-18 via ELISA or multiplex bead-based assays. These integrated methodologies offer a robust platform for studying the interplay between complement components and inflammasome activation in retinal pathology settings (Fernandezgodino2015alocalcomplement pages 10-11, Linetsky20184hydroxy7oxo5heptenoicacidlactone pages 3-5, Brandstetter2015complementcomponentc5a pages 2-3, Busch2017anaphylatoxinsactivateca2+ pages 3-4).
