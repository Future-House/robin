Query: Identify in vitro RPE cell culture models used for dry age-related macular degeneration research, including primary human RPE, ARPE-19, induced pluripotent stem cell–derived RPE, and 3D retinal organoids, and characterize their advantages, limitations, and phenotype fidelity

Answer:
Primary human RPE cells are isolated directly from donor eyes and most closely replicate the native RPE phenotype, exhibiting proper cell polarity, pigmentation, organized tight junctions, and functional attributes such as high transepithelial resistance (TER) and efficient phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments; however, their use is limited by donor-to-donor variability, finite proliferative capacity, and a tendency to dedifferentiate or lose pigmentation during prolonged culture (bharti2022cellculturemodels pages 3-4, bharti2022cellculturemodels pages 8-9).

The ARPE-19 cell line, a spontaneously immortalized human RPE model originally derived from adult tissue, is widely used due to its ease of handling, robust proliferation, and high amenability to genetic manipulation such as CRISPR/Cas9 modifications; nonetheless, ARPE-19 often shows lower phenotype fidelity compared to primary RPE, with features including abnormal karyotypes, poorly maintained epithelial organization, reduced polarization, and lower TER under standard culture conditions (bharti2022cellculturemodels pages 4-6, bharti2022cellculturemodels pages 1-3).

Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)–derived RPE cells represent an emerging and promising in vitro model that enables the production of patient-specific RPE cells; these cells can differentiate into RPE exhibiting key marker expression such as RPE65, BEST1, LRAT, and MITF, as well as displaying cobblestone morphology and functional phagocytosis, thereby allowing personalized approaches to study AMD-associated genetic risk factors and responses to cellular stressors (bharti2022cellculturemodels pages 29-32, mesch2023…modelfor pages 70-74).

However, iPSC-derived RPE models also show variability in differentiation protocols across laboratories, leading to heterogeneity in maturity and function, and require extensive timeline commitments for full maturation, thereby necessitating rigorous phenotypic validation and quality control measures to ensure consistency with native RPE biology (bharti2022cellculturemodels pages 12-14, mesch2023…modelfor pages 47-52).

Three-dimensional (3D) retinal organoids represent the most physiologically relevant systems by integrating RPE with neural retinal layers, which more closely simulates the in vivo retinal architecture and intercellular interactions; these models are capable of recapitulating key AMD hallmarks such as drusen formation, accumulation of extracellular material, and aging-related changes including lipid deposition and hydroxyapatite formation (mesch2023…modelfor pages 74-77, mesch2023…modelfor pages 6-9).

Despite their high phenotype fidelity and the capacity to model complex tissue structure, 3D retinal organoids are technically challenging to generate, require prolonged culture periods (often extending to several months for full maturation), and are resource-intensive due to issues like incomplete replication of Bruch’s membrane and lack of vascularization, thus limiting their scalability and throughput for high-level drug screening applications (mesch2023…modelfor pages 70-74, bharti2022cellculturemodels pages 14-16).

In summary, while primary human RPE cells offer the highest fidelity in capturing native cell characteristics, their limited availability and susceptibility to dedifferentiation restrict their long-term use; ARPE-19 cells provide a convenient and genetically tractable model but suffer from incomplete differentiation and reduced physiological relevance; iPSC-derived RPE cells bridge the gap by offering patient-specific models with improved maturity, albeit with variability that challenges reproducibility; and finally, 3D retinal organoids present the most complex and in vivo–like microenvironment necessary for studying dry AMD pathogenesis, despite their technical and practical limitations that currently hinder widespread adoption (bharti2022cellculturemodels pages 32-33, mesquita2021purificationandcharacterization pages 27-30).
