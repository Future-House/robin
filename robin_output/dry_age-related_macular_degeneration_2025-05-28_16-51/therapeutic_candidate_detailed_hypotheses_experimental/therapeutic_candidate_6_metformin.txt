Proposal for Metformin (Glucophage®, catalog D150959, Sigma-Aldrich)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Metformin (Glucophage®, catalog D150959, Sigma-Aldrich) is a synthetic biguanide that was originally derived from the plant Galega officinalis, historically known for its hypoglycemic properties. It belongs to the biguanide class of therapeutic compounds, which have long been used to manage type 2 diabetes mellitus through their capacity to lower blood glucose levels. The discovery of metformin’s beneficial metabolic effects dates back several decades, and it has since become the most widely prescribed oral antihyperglycemic agent. As a repurposing candidate for dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), metformin is of particular interest because its established safety profile, low cost, and demonstrated systemic efficacy make it attractive for chronic conditions beyond diabetes. In addition to its original indication, this compound has begun to attract attention as a modulator of cellular energy homeostasis and autophagic flux—a key consideration in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) dysfunction observed in dry AMD (Amin et al., 2022; Augustin & Atorf, 2023).

Therapeutic History:
Metformin has been in clinical use since the 1950s for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, where its primary action is reducing hepatic gluconeogenesis and improving insulin sensitivity. Over the years, extensive biochemical and clinical data have underscored its safety profile, with gastrointestinal discomfort being the most common side effect and serious adverse effects such as lactic acidosis occurring very rarely in patients with appropriate renal function (Amin et al., 2022; Augustin & Atorf, 2023). Beyond diabetes, epidemiological and preclinical studies have suggested that metformin may impart protection in various age-related and metabolic diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, cardiovascular diseases, and even certain neurodegenerative conditions. In the retinal field, several studies have examined its effects in experimental models of retinal degeneration and diabetic retinopathy, where metformin has been shown to reduce retinal inflammation, oxidative damage, and aberrant angiogenesis. Although direct clinical trial data in dry AMD are still emerging—with one completed phase II clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016) evaluating its effects on geographic atrophy progression in non-diabetic patients—the available preclinical and retrospective epidemiological evidence indicates that metformin may reduce the risk or progression of AMD (Eton et al., 2022; Romdhoniyyah et al., 2021). This history of repurposing for retinal diseases, coupled with its well-documented systemic tolerability, supports ongoing efforts to explore metformin as a therapeutic candidate specifically for dry AMD.

Mechanism of Action:
Metformin exerts its primary pharmacological action through the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a serine/threonine kinase that functions as a cellular energy sensor. When metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex I, there is an increase in the cellular AMP:ATP ratio, leading to robust activation of AMPK. This enzyme, which comprises multiple isoforms—including the critical AMPKα2 subunit expressed in retinal tissues—is responsible for initiating a cascade of downstream effects that restore cellular energy balance. Through AMPK activation, metformin induces a metabolic reprogramming that suppresses anabolic processes (such as fatty acid synthesis and protein translation) while enhancing catabolic pathways, notably increasing glycolysis, stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis, and upregulating oxidative defense mechanisms (Xu et al., 2018).

In the context of the retinal pigment epithelium, AMPK activation by metformin has been shown to promote autophagy—a vital cellular process that degrades and recycles damaged organelles and proteins. This is particularly significant for RPE cells, which are responsible for phagocytosing the daily shed outer segments of photoreceptors. Dysfunction in this autophagic process is a hallmark of dry AMD, as impaired clearance leads to the accumulation of toxic debris and lipofuscin, ultimately contributing to cellular senescence and degeneration (Abokyi, 2021; Amin et al., 2022). Further, metformin’s activation of AMPK in RPE cells upregulates key transcriptional factors and proteins—including PGC-1α, Nrf2, and Sirt1—that enhance mitochondrial function and protect against oxidative stress. This multifaceted mechanism is thought to stabilize the energy homeostasis in RPE cells and promote the maturation of autophagosomes, ultimately accelerating the clearance of photoreceptor debris—a process critical for maintaining retinal integrity in dry AMD (Amin et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2018).

Additionally, preclinical studies in vitro have demonstrated that metformin reduces reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and promotes the expression of antioxidants and tight junction proteins (such as occludin and ZO-1) in RPE cells. The compound’s ability to modulate inflammatory signaling pathways, such as NF-κB inhibition, further contributes to a reduction in the inflammatory milieu that exacerbates retinal degeneration. Collectively, these molecular interactions underscore the therapeutic rationale for using metformin to rectify the metabolic deficits and autophagic dysfunction observed in dry AMD (Amin et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2020).

Expected Effect:
In the proposed assay involving RPE cells and the dry AMD context, metformin is expected to activate AMPK in these cells, thereby enhancing their energy homeostasis and boosting autophagy-dependent phagosome maturation. This pharmacological intervention should lead to more efficient clearance of photoreceptor outer segment debris accumulated in RPE cells, a pathological hallmark of dry AMD. In vitro models using iPSC-derived RPE cells have validated that AMPK activation promotes autophagic flux and improves cellular viability under oxidative stress conditions. Based on these findings, metformin is anticipated to reduce ROS levels, decrease apoptotic cell death, and restore mitochondrial function in stressed RPE cells (Qu et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020).

Furthermore, metformin’s action is expected to be dose-dependent, supporting its repurposing in chronic retinal degenerative conditions. Preclinical animal models have demonstrated preservation of retinal architecture and function with metformin treatment, as evidenced by improved electrophysiological measurements and reduced thinning of the outer nuclear layer following oxidative or light-induced damage (Xu et al., 2018; Amin et al., 2022). Gene expression studies in these models indicate that metformin treatment leads to the upregulation of mitochondrial markers (such as COX-II and Tfam) and antioxidative enzymes, suggesting that its therapeutic benefit in dry AMD is mediated by enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and reduced oxidative stress (Xu et al., 2018; Buonfiglio et al., 2024).

Given that RPE cells express AMPK isoforms essential for autophagic activity, the expected effect of metformin in this context is a significant improvement in RPE cell function, stabilization of the blood-retina barrier, and a slowing in the progression of geographic atrophy. This is consistent with epidemiological data indicating that diabetic patients on metformin have a reduced risk of developing AMD, underscoring the translational relevance of the underlying mechanism (Romdhoniyyah et al., 2021; Augustin & Atorf, 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
Metformin emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate for dry age-related macular degeneration based on a convergence of biochemical, preclinical, and epidemiological evidence. The principal strengths of metformin include its well-established clinical safety profile, low cost, and decades-long history of systemic use that provides extensive real-world data on tolerability (Amin et al., 2022; Augustin & Atorf, 2023). Mechanistically, the drug’s ability to activate AMPK in retinal pigment epithelial cells addresses key pathological processes in dry AMD, such as impaired autophagy, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Preclinical data support that metformin enhances autophagic flux and promotes mitochondrial biogenesis, resulting in improved clearance of photoreceptor debris and preservation of RPE function—a novel approach that contrasts with more generalized metabolic modulators (Xu et al., 2018; Abokyi, 2021).

The expected therapeutic effect in dry AMD includes restoration of cellular energy homeostasis and enhanced clearance mechanisms in RPE cells, which, if translated clinically, could slow disease progression and improve visual outcomes. The epidemiological association between metformin use and reduced AMD risk provides additional, albeit indirect, support for its repurposing in this indication (Romdhoniyyah et al., 2021; Eton et al., 2022).

However, there are several challenges and weaknesses that must be addressed. First, while preclinical and in vitro models provide strong mechanistic rationale, direct clinical evidence specific to dry AMD remains limited. The single completed phase II study (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016) and retrospective data suggest potential benefits, but prospective randomized trials in non-diabetic AMD populations are needed to validate efficacy. Second, although metformin is known to cross certain tissue barriers, detailed pharmacokinetic studies on its ocular penetration and retinal bioavailability are sparse. This raises concerns about whether the dosing achieved systemically in diabetic patients is sufficient to elicit the desired effects in the retina without off-target toxicities. Third, the multifactorial nature of dry AMD—with contributions from genetic, environmental, and metabolic factors—means that a monotherapy approach may not be entirely effective, and metformin might need to be used in combination with other agents that address complement activation, extracellular matrix changes, or proinflammatory cascades.

Another potential concern is that not all studies have reported uniformly protective effects of metformin in retinal models; for example, some comparative studies of AMPK activators suggest that metformin’s variable impact on mitochondrial function could lead to less predictable results under acute oxidative stress conditions (Chan et al., 2020). This underlines the need for precise dosing regimens and patient selection strategies when considering its clinical application in a heterogeneous condition such as dry AMD.

Overall, the strengths of metformin—as a repurposed agent with a strong safety profile, clear mechanistic rationale via AMPK activation, and supportive preclinical evidence—make it a compelling candidate for further exploration in dry AMD. The weaknesses primarily surround the gaps in direct clinical evidence and uncertainties about ocular pharmacokinetics, which will need to be addressed in future studies. In summary, metformin’s ability to correct metabolic deficits and promote autophagic clearance in RPE cells is biologically plausible and supported by preclinical models and epidemiological data, warranting further translational research and ideally controlled clinical trials to establish its role in the treatment of dry AMD (Amin et al., 2022; Augustin & Atorf, 2023; Buonfiglio et al., 2024).
