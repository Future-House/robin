Proposal for N-Acetylcysteine (NAC, catalog A7250, Sigma-Aldrich)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) is a well-known thiol compound derived from the naturally occurring amino acid L-cysteine. It is synthesized by acetylating the amino group of cysteine, which not only improves its chemical stability but also enhances its solubility and bioavailability relative to cysteine itself (Atkuri, Mantovani, Herzenberg, & Herzenberg, 2007). Belonging to the class of mucolytic and antioxidant agents, NAC has found widespread use as a precursor for the synthesis of glutathione (GSH)—the primary intracellular antioxidant responsible for neutralizing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. Historically, this compound was serendipitously discovered when its mucolytic properties were exploited in respiratory conditions; however, its ability to serve as a cysteine prodrug has given it a much broader therapeutic appeal in diverse oxidative stress–related conditions (Atkuri et al., 2007; Dodd, Dean, Copolov, Malhi, & Berk, 2008). In the broader context of drug development, thiol compounds like NAC have been extensively investigated due to their capacity to replenish intracellular GSH levels by supplying cysteine—the rate-limiting substrate in glutathione biosynthesis—which has led to therapeutic applications in acetaminophen overdose, pulmonary diseases, and even in certain neuropsychiatric conditions (Dodd et al., 2008).

Therapeutic History:
NAC has enjoyed a long and successful history in both clinical and preclinical settings. It was approved by the FDA for the treatment of acetaminophen (paracetamol) overdose due to its efficacy in replenishing hepatic GSH stores and mitigating hepatotoxicity, which established its safety profile and tolerability in acute and chronic dosing scenarios (Atkuri et al., 2007; Dodd et al., 2008). Beyond its hepatoprotective role, NAC has also been employed as a mucolytic treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and its antioxidant activity has led to investigations in conditions such as cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, and various inflammatory disorders (Dodd et al., 2008). More recently, research has started to explore the potential of NAC in ocular applications, particularly in the context of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Preclinical studies have assessed NAC’s efficacy in protecting retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells from oxidative stress—a key pathological feature of dry AMD—by examining its ability to neutralize ROS, reduce oxidative damage, and replenish intracellular GSH (Hutnik, Kagan, & Liu, 2012; Radomska, 2012). Although direct clinical trials specifically targeting dry AMD with NAC remain limited, several clinical trial protocols (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2023) have incorporated NAC as a therapeutic adjunct, underscoring the growing translational interest in repurposing this well-characterized drug for retinal disorders. This extensive therapeutic history not only demonstrates NAC’s multifaceted utility in systemic diseases but also highlights its potential versatility for chronic ocular conditions where oxidative stress is a critical element in disease progression.

Mechanism of Action:
The primary mechanism of NAC is predicated on its role as a cysteine prodrug, which facilitates the intracellular synthesis of glutathione—a tripeptide composed of glutamate, cysteine, and glycine that plays a pivotal role in neutralizing ROS and maintaining redox balance (Atkuri et al., 2007; Dodd et al., 2008). At the molecular level, once administered, NAC is absorbed through biological membranes, including the blood–retinal barrier (BRB), due to its small molecular weight and favorable physicochemical properties (Hutnik et al., 2012; Dodd et al., 2008). Intracellularly, NAC is deacetylated to L-cysteine, which serves as the limiting substrate in the glutathione biosynthesis pathway. This enhanced availability of cysteine leads to an increase in the synthesis of GSH, thereby replenishing depleted intracellular stores and enabling the cellular antioxidant system to quench harmful ROS such as superoxide radicals, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radicals (Atkuri et al., 2007; Radomska, 2012).

In addition to its indirect antioxidant effect through GSH replenishment, NAC is also capable of directly scavenging free radicals via its sulfhydryl (–SH) group, although this direct effect is modest compared to its role in enhancing glutathione synthesis (Dodd et al., 2008; Atkuri et al., 2007). The compound’s ability to modulate redox-sensitive signaling pathways, including the inhibition of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway and other pro-inflammatory mediators, further contributes to its overall cytoprotective effect in various cell types, including RPE cells (Radomska, 2012). Recent studies in retinal models have shown that NAC pretreatment in RPE cells subjected to oxidative stress not only maintains glutathione levels but also improves mitochondrial function, thereby reducing apoptosis and preserving cell viability (Terluk et al., 2019; Hutnik et al., 2012). Furthermore, NAC has been implicated in the restoration of critical cellular clearance mechanisms, such as the phagosome–lysosome fusion process necessary for the degradation of photoreceptor outer segments—an essential function of RPE cells that becomes impaired in dry AMD (Hutnik et al., 2012; Radomska, 2012). This dual action—both in replenishing the cellular antioxidant capacity and in mitigating oxidative damage through improved mitochondrial and lysosomal function—forms the crux of the proposed therapeutic mechanism by which NAC may exert beneficial effects in the context of dry AMD.

Expected Effect:
The proposed therapeutic effect of NAC in dry AMD centers on its ability to restore redox homeostasis within RPE cells by both replenishing intracellular glutathione and directly neutralizing ROS. In the context of dry AMD, oxidative stress plays a critical role in driving RPE dysfunction, leading to the accumulation of toxic byproducts such as lipofuscin—a pigment composed of oxidized lipids and proteins that impairs normal cellular function—and deficits in the phagosome–lysosome fusion process, which is vital for the clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (Hutnik et al., 2012; Terluk et al., 2019). By supplying cysteine for glutathione biosynthesis, NAC is expected to increase intracellular GSH levels, thereby improving the antioxidant capacity of RPE cells and reducing the burden of ROS (Atkuri et al., 2007; Dodd et al., 2008). Improved glutathione availability can also bolster mitochondrial function and enhance the overall cellular energy status, which is crucial in tissues with high metabolic demand such as the retina (Terluk et al., 2019; Hutnik et al., 2012).

Moreover, the antioxidant effects of NAC are anticipated to prevent the formation or accumulation of lipofuscin within RPE cells by curbing the oxidative modifications of cellular proteins and lipids that contribute to lipofuscinogenesis (Radomska, 2012; Hutnik et al., 2012). Additionally, by mitigating the oxidative stress that disrupts normal degradative pathways, NAC is hypothesized to help restore the efficiency of the phagosome–lysosome fusion process, thereby enhancing the clearance of photoreceptor outer segments and maintaining retinal homeostasis (Hutnik et al., 2012; Terluk et al., 2019). These expected cellular outcomes are particularly significant given that RPE cell dysfunction is a central event in the pathogenesis of dry AMD. The expected preservation of RPE cell viability and function following NAC treatment would likely translate into slowed progression of the disease, improved structural integrity of the retina, and possible stabilization or improvement of visual function, as has been suggested by preclinical data and early-phase clinical investigations (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
Evaluating NAC as a potential repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry AMD reveals several compelling strengths alongside certain limitations that merit further investigation. One of NAC’s primary strengths is its well-established safety profile and widespread clinical use in a variety of oxidative stress–related conditions, ranging from acetaminophen toxicity to chronic pulmonary diseases. This long-standing clinical history supports its potential for chronic administration in a condition like dry AMD that requires long-term treatment (Atkuri et al., 2007; Dodd et al., 2008). Moreover, NAC’s low molecular weight and favorable pharmacokinetic properties—including oral availability and the capacity to penetrate biological barriers such as the BRB—are key attributes that underlie its feasible delivery to retinal tissues (Hutnik et al., 2012; Dodd et al., 2008).

From a mechanistic standpoint, the dual action of NAC—both as an indirect antioxidant via glutathione replenishment and as a direct ROS scavenger—addresses the multifactorial pathogenesis of dry AMD by reducing oxidative stress, maintaining mitochondrial function, and potentially restoring autophagic clearance processes in RPE cells (Radomska, 2012; Terluk et al., 2019). This is particularly valuable given that oxidative damage, lipofuscin accumulation, and impaired phagosome–lysosome fusion are established contributors to RPE degeneration and the progression of dry AMD (Hutnik et al., 2012; Terluk et al., 2019).

However, NAC’s relatively modest direct free radical scavenging capacity and issues with cell permeability have been noted in some studies, and these limitations have prompted research into derivative compounds like N-acetylcysteine ethyl ester (NACET) that demonstrate improved lipophilicity and cellular uptake (Realini, 2022; Tosi et al., 2021). While NAC itself remains a promising candidate due to its extensive clinical record and known mechanism of action, the possibility that its efficacy in RPE cells could be enhanced through formulation modifications or by developing lipophilic prodrugs should be considered as part of a broader drug development strategy (Tosi et al., 2021; Realini, 2022).

Overall, the evidence from biochemical and preclinical literature provides a strong mechanistic rationale for repurposing NAC in dry AMD. Its established safety, oral bioavailability, and capacity to replenish intracellular glutathione make it a strong candidate for therapeutic intervention targeting oxidative stress and RPE dysfunction. Nevertheless, further studies are warranted to optimize drug delivery to the retina, confirm its efficacy in preventing key pathological features such as lipofuscin accumulation and phagosome–lysosome fusion deficits, and to establish its clinical efficacy in slowing or reversing the progression of dry AMD (Hutnik et al., 2012; Terluk et al., 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2023). In summary, while there are limitations that require further study—particularly regarding cell permeability and the comparative efficacy of NAC relative to its more lipophilic derivatives—the overall profile of NAC as an antioxidant, glutathione-replenishing agent with proven safety in multiple indications supports its continued evaluation and development as a repurposed candidate for the treatment of dry age-related macular degeneration.
