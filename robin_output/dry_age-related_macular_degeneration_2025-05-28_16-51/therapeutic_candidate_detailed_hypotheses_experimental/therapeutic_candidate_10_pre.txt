Proposal for PRE-084 (catalog 2697, Tocris)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
PRE-084 is a synthetic small-molecule agent originally discovered and characterized as a selective sigma-1 receptor (S1R) agonist that belongs to the pharmacological class of sigma-1 receptor ligands (Mancuso & Navarro, 2017). Its chemical structure is based on adamantane derivatives that allow high-affinity binding to S1R, and it was initially synthesized as part of efforts to modulate neuroprotective pathways, with early investigations highlighting its ability to cross the blood–brain barrier and engage central nervous system targets (Cantarella et al., 2007). As a member of the sigma receptor modulators, PRE-084 has been developed for research applications in neuroprotection, and similar compounds of this class have traditionally been used in preclinical models of neurodegeneration, with particular emphasis on their ability to modulate intracellular calcium signaling at the mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (Mavlyutov et al., 2022). The molecule’s mechanism of action and physicochemical properties predict its potential for ocular uptake, making it a promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of ocular disorders like dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (Merlos et al., 2017).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, sigma-1 receptor agonists, including PRE-084, have been extensively investigated in various models of neurodegenerative and retinal diseases; preclinical studies in models of retinal ischemia–reperfusion injury and retinal ganglion cell degeneration have demonstrated robust neuroprotective effects following sigma-1 receptor activation (Mysona et al., 2017). Although PRE-084 has not been previously used in clinical trials specifically for dry AMD, its use in rodent retinal models has shown attenuation of oxidative damage, reduced ER stress, and protection against apoptosis in retinal neurons, which are all relevant mechanisms in dry AMD pathophysiology (Nguyen et al., 2015). In addition, studies employing sigma-1 receptor modulation in retinal cell lines and animal models of photoreceptor degeneration indicate that activation of S1R can lead to neuroprotection by stabilizing mitochondrial function and improving cellular autophagic responses (Bucolo et al., 2006). Furthermore, related sigma-1 receptor agonists such as (+)-pentazocine and cutamesine have been used to protect retinal integrity in experimental models, suggesting that the sigma-1 receptor ligand class possesses a strong preclinical track record in neuroprotection and retinal preservation, even though direct clinical use in human dry AMD has yet to be established (Merlos et al., 2017). The available preclinical safety data from central nervous system applications and rodent models further facilitate the repurposing of PRE-084 for ocular use given its acceptable tolerability profile in non-ocular settings (Mancuso & Navarro, 2017).

Mechanism of Action:
PRE-084 functions as a selective agonist at the sigma-1 receptor, a unique ligand-operated molecular chaperone that is predominantly localized at the mitochondria-associated ER membrane (MAM) (Cantarella et al., 2007). Upon binding to S1R, PRE-084 is known to facilitate key cellular processes including the regulation of intracellular calcium signaling by stabilizing the inositol triphosphate receptor (IP3R) complex; this stabilization promotes efficient calcium transfer from the ER to mitochondria, which is critical for maintaining mitochondrial bioenergetics and overall cell survival (Mancuso & Navarro, 2017). Activation of sigma-1 receptor by PRE-084 modulates the unfolded protein response (UPR) and attenuates ER stress by interacting with chaperone proteins such as BiP/GRP78, thereby restoring proteostasis under stressful cellular conditions (Wang et al., 2017). This agent also upregulates autophagic flux, allowing the cell to clear damaged proteins and organelles, which is paramount in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells that continuously manage large quantities of photoreceptor outer segments (Bucolo et al., 2006). Moreover, PRE-084 indirectly supports the antioxidant response by enhancing NRF2-mediated transcription, further protecting retinal cells from oxidative damage, a significant contributor to dry AMD pathology (Nguyen et al., 2015). In addition to ER stress modulation, sigma-1 receptor activation by PRE-084 has been shown to improve mitochondrial dynamics and reduce apoptosis markers such as Bax and caspase-3, thereby contributing to improved cell survival in neurodegenerative settings (Unknown Reference).

Expected Effect:
In the context of dry AMD, the proposed hypothesis is that PRE-084 will enhance ER–mitochondrial calcium signaling in RPE cells, ultimately promoting mitochondrial health, inducing autophagy, and improving the phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments (Mavlyutov et al., 2022). Given that RPE cells are critical for the maintenance and recycling of photoreceptor outer segments, the restoration of proper calcium homeostasis and the reduction in ER stress are expected to improve their ability to manage oxidative stress and maintain cellular viability (Ola et al., 2001). PRE-084 is anticipated to modulate key intracellular signaling pathways by activating sigma-1 receptors that are endogenously expressed in both RPE and retinal neuronal cells, thereby leading to a reduction in apoptosis and an increase in autophagic clearance of cellular debris (Merlos et al., 2017). This cellular protection should translate into improved retinal cell function and potentially slow the progression of dry AMD by preserving the structural and functional integrity of the RPE layer, which is central to photoreceptor nutrition and overall retinal health (Mysona et al., 2017). The expectation is supported by previous studies where sigma-1 receptor activation by similar ligands has resulted in sustained cell survival under conditions of oxidative and ER stress, effectively mitigating degenerative processes in retinal cells (Nguyen et al., 2015). PRE-084’s modulation of ER stress and mitochondrial function is hypothesized to promote efficient phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments—a process that is known to be compromised in dry AMD—and thereby restore RPE cell homeostasis (Wang et al., 2017).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, PRE-084 represents a promising therapeutic candidate for dry age-related macular degeneration due to its strong preclinical foundation in neuroprotection and its ability to modulate key cellular stress pathways implicated in retinal degeneration (Mancuso & Navarro, 2017). The strengths of this candidate include its well-documented mechanism of action involving the restoration of ER homeostasis, enhancement of mitochondrial bioenergetics, promotion of autophagy, and regulation of intracellular calcium signaling—all of which are critical in maintaining RPE cell function under stress conditions (Wang et al., 2017). Additionally, the sigma-1 receptor is known to be expressed in retinal cells and has been shown to confer protective effects in preclinical models of retinal neurodegeneration, which lends credence to the hypothesis that its activation by PRE-084 could prove beneficial in dry AMD (Cantarella et al., 2007; Nguyen et al., 2015). Furthermore, the small-molecule nature of PRE-084, coupled with its proven brain penetration, suggests that achieving sufficient ocular uptake may be feasible, thereby facilitating its translation into an ocular therapeutic (Mavlyutov et al., 2022). However, certain weaknesses and limitations must be considered—for instance, direct evidence of PRE-084’s efficacy specifically in RPE or dry AMD models remains limited, and detailed pharmacokinetic and ocular safety data are currently lacking (Merlos et al., 2017). Additionally, while preclinical data in neuroprotective and retinal degeneration models are promising, significant translational hurdles such as optimized ocular delivery, dose determination, and long-term safety profiling in humans will need to be addressed (Nguyen et al., 2015). In conclusion, PRE-084 has a solid mechanistic rationale and a strong preclinical record in related neurodegenerative contexts, making it an attractive candidate for further investigation in dry AMD; however, focused studies using RPE-specific and dry AMD-relevant models, as well as detailed ocular pharmacokinetic and safety evaluations, are imperative before advancing to clinical trials (Motawe et al., 2020; Mysona et al., 2017).
