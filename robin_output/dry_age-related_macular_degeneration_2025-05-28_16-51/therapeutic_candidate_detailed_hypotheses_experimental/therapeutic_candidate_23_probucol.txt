Proposal for Probucol (catalog P9425, Sigma-Aldrich)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Probucol is a synthetic bisphenol compound originally developed as a lipid‐lowering agent to treat hyperlipoproteinemia and cardiovascular diseases. Its synthesis and development date back several decades, and its chemical structure confers both lipophilic and antioxidant properties. As a member of the antioxidant and lipid‐modulating drug class, probucol has been utilized primarily for its ability to lower cholesterol levels and inhibit lipid peroxidation. Traditionally, this class of compounds has been used to manage atherosclerosis and related cardiovascular conditions by reducing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation and attenuating inflammatory processes in blood vessels (Cai et al., 2021, pp. 5–6; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
Probucol’s therapeutic history is extensive in the context of cardiovascular disease management; it has been well documented as a lipid-lowering agent with robust antioxidant efficacy. In preclinical studies, probucol has reduced oxidative stress markers, inhibited lipid peroxidation, and shown anti-inflammatory effects in several tissues. Notably, it has been applied in models of diabetic retinopathy, where its antioxidant property, derived in part from upregulation of Nrf2, led to prevention of retinal neuronal degeneration (Liu et al., 2020, pp. 5–6, 7–8). While no registered clinical trials have directly explored its efficacy in dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) according to the available Clinical Trials Search (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), the biomolecular rationale derived from its cardiovascular and diabetic retinopathy studies provides an impetus for its repurposing. Its historic use in the cardiovascular arena, a field with extensive clinical validation, is now steering investigations into ocular applications, particularly those characterized by high oxidative stress and lipid dysregulation such as dry AMD (Cai et al., 2021, pp. 1–2, 12–14).

Mechanism of Action:
Probucol’s mechanism of action is multifaceted and operates primarily through its antioxidant and lipid-lowering capacities. One central mechanism involves modulation of the Keap1-Nrf2-ARE antioxidant pathway. Under oxidative stress conditions, the transcription factor Nrf2 normally dissociates from its cytoplasmic inhibitor Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) and translocates to the nucleus where it activates the transcription of a host of cytoprotective, phase II detoxifying enzymes (Cai et al., 2021, pp. 6–8). Probucol has been shown in experimental models to facilitate the dissociation of the Keap1-Nrf2 complex, thereby preventing Nrf2 degradation. The subsequent increase in nuclear Nrf2 levels results in the upregulation of antioxidant enzymes such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and enzymes involved in glutathione metabolism (Cai et al., 2021, pp. 8–9). These enzymes play essential roles in neutralizing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and protecting cells from oxidative stress.

In addition to its effects on antioxidant pathways, probucol exerts significant lipid-lowering actions by enhancing low-density lipoprotein catabolism and reducing the oxidative modification of lipids. This dual activity is especially relevant to retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells in the context of dry AMD. The RPE is exposed to a high concentration of polyunsaturated lipids and is subject to extensive oxidative stress due to constant phagocytic activity—the daily processing of photoreceptor outer segments. Excessive lipid peroxidation in RPE cells destabilizes lysosomal membranes and impairs the phagolysosomal degradation process (Cai et al., 2021, pp. 5–6; Wang et al., 2020, p. 7). Probucol’s lipid-modulating effects could reduce accumulation of oxidative lipid byproducts thereby preserving lysosomal integrity.

Furthermore, by reducing ROS levels and stabilizing the intracellular redox state, probucol may indirectly promote proper lysosomal function. This is significant because lysosomal stabilization in RPE cells is critical for efficient degradation of photoreceptor outer segments; failure in this process contributes to the accumulation of toxic debris, lipofuscin formation, and ultimately cellular dysfunction, all central to the pathogenesis of dry AMD (Cai et al., 2021, p. 14; Moekotte et al., 2024, pp. 19–24). In summary, on a molecular level, probucol’s interactions with the Keap1-Nrf2 system, combined with its capacity to lower lipid peroxidation, support its potential role in reducing oxidative damage, stabilizing lysosomal membranes, and promoting phagolysosomal degradation in RPE cells.

Expected Effect:
Based on the established mechanisms, the expected effect of probucol in assays relevant to dry AMD would be the mitigation of oxidative stress in RPE cells. This includes the reduction of intracellular ROS and lipid peroxidation, as well as the stabilization of lysosomal membranes leading to improved phagolysosomal function. Biochemically, an upregulation of Nrf2 and its downstream antioxidant targets should be observable in probucol-treated RPE cells (Cai et al., 2021, pp. 6–8). Such an effect could be validated by measuring increases in HO-1, NQO1, and glutathione-related enzymes in cell culture systems that simulate oxidative stress conditions akin to those in dry AMD.

In addition, since RPE cells express proteins critical for phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments, such as the CD36 receptor and components involved in the degradative lysosomal system, improved lysosomal activity can be monitored using assays that assess phagolysosomal degradation efficiency. Probucol is expected to enhance this degradation process by protecting lysosomal membranes from oxidative impairment and supporting the autophagic flux necessary for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis (Cai et al., 2021, pp. 1–2; Zhou et al., 2023, pp. 9–10; Wang et al., 2020, p. 7). Clinical observations in related models, such as diabetic retinopathy, have shown probucol to reduce apoptosis and ROS generation, effects that could translate into benefits for dry AMD pathology. Thus, in a well-designed preclinical assay, one would expect to see decreased markers of oxidative damage and improved clearance of photoreceptor debris in RPE cells with probucol treatment, aligning with the proposed protective mechanism in dry AMD.

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, probucol presents as a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in the treatment of dry age-related macular degeneration based on its dual functions as an antioxidant and lipid-lowering agent. A major strength of probucol is its established safety profile from decades of clinical use in cardiovascular disease, which bodes well for its translational potential in new indications. Its ability to modulate the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway and upregulate endogenous antioxidant defenses addresses the central mechanistic underpinning of retinal oxidative stress seen in dry AMD (Cai et al., 2021, pp. 6–8; Liu et al., 2020, pp. 5–6). Moreover, the lipid-lowering properties of probucol may ameliorate the deleterious accumulation of oxidized lipids within RPE cells and contribute to the stabilization of lysosomal membranes—both critical for maintaining proper phagolysosomal degradation of photoreceptor outer segments (Cai et al., 2021, pp. 8–9; Moekotte et al., 2024, pp. 19–24).

However, there are several weaknesses that must be carefully considered. Most notably, while preclinical and biochemical studies in related retinal models support the antioxidative and cytoprotective actions of probucol, direct evidence from preclinical models or clinical trials specifically targeting dry AMD is currently lacking (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). The absence of direct published data in dry AMD necessitates further rigorous investigation in appropriate animal models that closely mimic the human condition of dry AMD, particularly focusing on RPE phagolysosomal function and photoreceptor outer segment clearance. Additionally, as probucol is known to have poor oral bioavailability (<10%) and is highly lipophilic, formulation challenges must be addressed to ensure sufficient drug levels reach retinal tissues. Novel drug delivery approaches, such as nano- or micro-encapsulation strategies, may be required to overcome these pharmacokinetic limitations and ensure targeted delivery to the retina (Cai et al., 2021, pp. 8–9).

Another potential concern is the complexity of dry AMD pathogenesis, which involves not only oxidative stress and lipid dysregulation, but also inflammatory pathways, choroidal blood flow alterations, and genetic predispositions. Therefore, while probucol is mechanistically sound in targeting oxidative stress and lipid metabolism, its efficacy in the multifactorial context of dry AMD remains to be conclusively determined. It is also important to note that past studies, such as those conducted in diabetic retinopathy models, while supportive of probucol’s antioxidant potential, have primarily focused on neuronal protection rather than the specific pathology of dry AMD, which involves distinctive alterations in RPE lysosomal function (Liu et al., 2020, pp. 7–8; Cai et al., 2021, p. 14).

In conclusion, the overall evaluation of probucol for the treatment of dry AMD is cautiously optimistic. Its favorable safety profile, established mechanism of action via enhancement of the Keap1-Nrf2 antioxidant pathway, and lipid-lowering properties provide a strong biochemical and mechanistic rationale for its repurposing. However, critical gaps in direct clinical or preclinical evidence in the AMD context mandate further focused research. Necessary steps include detailed in vitro assays using RPE cell lines to assess lysosomal stability and phagolysosomal degradation, followed by comprehensive in vivo studies in relevant animal models of dry AMD to assess retinal structural and functional outcomes. Addressing formulation challenges due to poor oral bioavailability will also be crucial for successful translation into clinical use. With these additional studies, probucol could represent a valuable therapeutic candidate that targets key pathogenic factors of dry AMD, such as oxidative stress, lipid dysregulation, and impaired RPE degradation capability (Cai et al., 2021, pp. 1–2; Zhou et al., 2023, pp. 9–10; Wang et al., 2020, p. 7).
