Proposal for Dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera®, catalog 46795, Sigma-Aldrich)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Dimethyl fumarate (DMF, marketed as Tecfidera®) is a methyl ester derivative of fumaric acid that was originally discovered as a naturally occurring substance present in fumaric acid–rich plants such as Fumaria officinalis. It belongs to the class of fumaric acid esters, whose mode of action has been exploited primarily in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. DMF is synthesized through chemical esterification of fumaric acid and has been formulated as an oral drug with a well‐characterized pharmacokinetic profile. As a member of this class, it has been extensively used in the treatment of relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis and psoriasis, where its immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties are key to its therapeutic benefit (Buonfiglio et al., 2024; Manai et al., 2022). The fact that DMF is a small, lipophilic molecule also enables it to cross the blood–retinal barrier (BRB), suggesting its potential utility in ocular applications, an important consideration when evaluating repurposing candidates for retinal diseases such as dry age-related macular degeneration (dry AMD).

Therapeutic History:
DMF has a long-standing history of clinical use in non‐ocular indications. Its approval for relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis and psoriasis is underpinned by comprehensive clinical data demonstrating its immunomodulatory and neuroprotective effects along with a favorable safety profile (Manai et al., 2022). In multiple sclerosis, DMF reduces inflammatory relapses and modifies disease progression in part by shifting immune responses towards a less inflammatory phenotype. Similarly, in psoriasis, DMF modulates cytokine profiles and reduces keratinocyte hyperproliferation, underscoring its anti-inflammatory capabilities. Despite these successes in non-ocular conditions, direct clinical use of DMF in dry AMD or similar retinal degenerative diseases has not been fully established. However, preclinical studies in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells and animal models of ocular diseases have suggested that DMF may confer protective benefits in the retina, due to its ability to activate Nrf2—an essential transcription factor in cellular antioxidant defense—and suppress NF-κB–mediated proinflammatory signaling (Catanzaro et al., 2020; Giunta et al., 2023). Moreover, a clinical trial is currently registered to evaluate the effects of oral DMF on geographic atrophy, a late‐stage manifestation of dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2022). These observations, combined with the extensive clinical safety data available for DMF, support a rationale for its rapid repurposing into the ocular domain.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, DMF exerts its effects primarily by activating the nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway. Under basal conditions, Nrf2 is sequestered in the cytoplasm by its repressor, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1). DMF interacts with Keap1 cysteine residues through Michael addition reactions, thereby modifying Keap1 and inhibiting its ability to promote Nrf2 degradation. This leads to the stabilization and nuclear translocation of Nrf2, where it binds to antioxidant response elements (AREs) in the promoters of target genes (Manai et al., 2022). As a consequence, a cascade of cytoprotective genes is induced, including those encoding phase II detoxifying enzymes such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and enzymes critical for glutathione synthesis (such as glutamate–cysteine ligase). These enzymes collectively enhance cellular antioxidant capacity and improve resistance to oxidative stress (Chen et al., 2012).

In addition to its primary antioxidant function, DMF exerts anti-inflammatory effects by modulating the NF-κB signaling pathway. DMF inhibits the nuclear translocation of NF-κB’s p65 subunit, thereby reducing the transcription of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and other mediators that contribute to the inflammatory milieu observed in dry AMD (Manai et al., 2022; Shimizu et al., 2022). Moreover, DMF indirectly modulates immune responses by affecting cellular metabolism; it succinates key glycolytic enzymes like glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), thereby downregulating aerobic glycolysis, which is often upregulated in inflammatory states (Manai et al., 2022). In experimental models, DMF has been demonstrated to promote neuroprotection via these mechanisms, reducing oxidative damage, dampening inflammatory cytokine secretion, and even modulating autophagic flux (Manai et al., 2022; Shimizu et al., 2022). Although the precise link between Nrf2 activation by DMF and the restoration of lysosomal function in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells remains to be fully elucidated, there is indirect evidence suggesting that improved autophagy via Nrf2 activation can enhance lysosomal clearance and phagocytic clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (Catanzaro et al., 2020; Manai et al., 2022). This biochemical cascade is particularly relevant to AMD pathogenesis, where oxidative stress and impaired proteostasis play central roles.

Expected Effect in RPE and Dry AMD:
In the context of dry AMD, the retinal pigment epithelium is exposed to persistent oxidative stress, which compromises its ability to support photoreceptor function through impaired lysosomal degradation and inefficient phagocytic clearance of photoreceptor outer segments. The expected pharmacological effect of DMF in this cellular environment is multifaceted. First, by activating the Nrf2 pathway, DMF is expected to upregulate a suite of antioxidant enzymes (including HO-1 and NQO1) that can neutralize reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby reducing oxidative damage within RPE cells (Buonfiglio et al., 2024; Catanzaro et al., 2020). Second, through its inhibition of NF-κB, DMF should decrease the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that contribute to chronic inflammation in the RPE layer, a key pathogenic feature of dry AMD (Manai et al., 2022; Marchesi et al., 2024). Furthermore, preclinical studies in RPE cell models have shown that DMF can improve mitochondrial function and reduce apoptosis under conditions of oxidative stress, as demonstrated in cell culture models exposed to blue light—a known inducer of oxidative damage mimicking the environmental insults experienced in AMD (Shimizu et al., 2022). With respect to lysosomal function and phagocytic clearance, the hypothesis is that DMF-mediated activation of Nrf2 may restore autophagic and lysosomal pathways that are critical for the digestion and recycling of photoreceptor outer segments. Although direct evidence in RPE cells specifically showing enhanced lysosomal clearance by DMF is limited, the link between robust Nrf2 signaling, improved autophagy, and proteostasis has been established in various cell types (Manai et al., 2022; Catanzaro et al., 2020). The overall expected downstream outcome is improved RPE homeostasis, which in turn should preserve photoreceptor viability and slow the progression of geographic atrophy, the advanced stage of dry AMD.

Overall Evaluation:
The repurposing of dimethyl fumarate as a therapeutic candidate for dry AMD is an intriguing prospect that is grounded in strong mechanistic rationale. Among the key strengths is its well-documented capacity to activate the Nrf2 transcription factor, thereby upregulating a wide range of antioxidant and cytoprotective genes crucial for mitigating oxidative stress—a critical contributor to RPE degeneration in dry AMD (Buonfiglio et al., 2024; Manai et al., 2022). Alongside its antioxidant effects, DMF also exhibits potent anti-inflammatory properties through the inhibition of NF-κB signaling, which could provide dual protection by reducing the chronic inflammatory environment seen in AMD (Manai et al., 2022; Marchesi et al., 2024).

Another clear strength of DMF is its extensive clinical safety record in multiple sclerosis and psoriasis. This existing clinical data supports the feasibility of repurposing DMF for ocular indications, as it offers established dosage guidelines and safety profiles, potentially accelerating the translation of preclinical findings into clinical trials for dry AMD (Manai et al., 2022; Giunta et al., 2023). In addition, DMF’s small molecular size and lipophilicity are beneficial for crossing the blood–retinal barrier and directly targeting retinal cells, a property that further underpins its potential use in treating retinal diseases (Manai et al., 2022; Buonfiglio et al., 2024).

However, several weaknesses or uncertainties remain. One major challenge is that although there is strong preclinical evidence associating DMF with Nrf2 activation and reduction of oxidative stress in retinal cells, the direct effects of DMF on lysosomal function and enhancement of phagocytic clearance in RPE cells have not been unequivocally demonstrated in published studies (Catanzaro et al., 2020; Manai et al., 2022). While the mechanistic hypothesis is well founded, the absence of direct data means that further focused studies—including detailed analyses of autophagy markers and phagocytic efficiency in RPE cells treated with DMF—are needed to fully validate this aspect of the therapeutic candidate’s potential (Marchesi et al., 2024).

Additionally, while repurposing benefits from an established clinical profile in other diseases, the ocular microenvironment presents unique challenges. For example, the immune-privileged status of the eye and the specific metabolic demands of RPE cells may influence DMF’s pharmacodynamics in ways that are not yet fully understood. There is also the concern that transient depletion of glutathione caused by DMF, as noted in some studies, might temporarily render RPE cells more vulnerable to oxidative insults if dosing and administration are not optimally managed (Chen et al., 2012). Moreover, while clinical trials in geographic atrophy are underway (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2022), the direct translation of the multi-faceted effects observed in non-ocular models to the complex pathophysiology of dry AMD remains to be demonstrated clinically.

In summary, dimethyl fumarate presents a promising candidate for dry AMD therapy due to its dual capacity to activate Nrf2-mediated antioxidant defenses and suppress NF-κB–driven inflammatory responses. Its use is further supported by an extensive clinical history in other indications, promising a potential for rapid repurposing. However, before the candidate can be definitively advanced, further preclinical studies are warranted to specifically address its impact on lysosomal function and phagocytic clearance in retinal pigment epithelial cells. These additional studies should include detailed mechanistic evaluations in AMD-relevant models and careful titration of dosing to balance the initial depletion of endogenous antioxidants with the subsequent upregulation of protective pathways. Overall, while there are clear strengths that lend strong theoretical support to DMF’s use in dry AMD, the gaps in direct mechanistic evidence in the ocular context warrant additional investigation to fully substantiate its therapeutic potential (Shimizu et al., 2022; Manai et al., 2022; Marchesi et al., 2024; Giunta et al., 2023).
