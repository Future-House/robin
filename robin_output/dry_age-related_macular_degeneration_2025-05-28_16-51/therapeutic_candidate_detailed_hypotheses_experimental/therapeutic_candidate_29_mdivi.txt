Proposal for Mdivi-1 (catalog M0199, Sigma-Aldrich)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Mdivi‐1 is a small‐molecule compound originally discovered as a mitochondrial division inhibitor that targets the enzymatic activity of dynamin‐related protein 1 (Drp1) (Smith & Gallo, 2017). It belongs to the class of compounds that modulate mitochondrial dynamics by reducing excessive fission, thereby preserving or restoring the mitochondrial network integrity. Mdivi‐1 (catalog M0199, Sigma‐Aldrich) is a synthetic small molecule that was first identified through chemical screening aimed at finding inhibitors of mitochondrial division in yeast, and then later applied to mammalian cells, particularly in contexts where mitochondrial fragmentation is pathogenic (Bordt et al., 2017; Manczak et al., 2019). As a mitochondrial division inhibitor, it falls within a broader class of mitochondrial‐targeted therapeutic candidates that have been investigated in neurodegenerative and ischemic disease models, where the maintenance of mitochondrial network integrity is critical for cell survival. The synthetic origins of Mdivi‐1 are rooted in medicinal chemistry efforts to identify quinazolinone derivatives that can specifically interfere with the fission machinery, and it has since been repurposed for investigations in other degenerative disorders such as retinal degeneration, based on its biochemical mechanism (Smith & Gallo, 2017).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, Mdivi‐1 has been extensively studied in preclinical research primarily for its neuroprotective effects in models of brain ischemia, traumatic brain injury, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and Huntington’s disease (Bordt et al., 2017; Manczak et al., 2019). Its mechanism as an inhibitor of Drp1 was originally thought to stem from a direct inhibition of the Drp1 GTPase activity, although subsequent studies revealed that some of its cellular effects may also involve reversible inhibition of mitochondrial complex I and modulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (Bordt et al., 2017; Manczak et al., 2019). In terms of translational research, although Mdivi‐1 has been widely used in over a hundred preclinical studies addressing mitochondrial dysfunction, its application in ocular diseases has been more limited. A search of ClinicalTrials.gov for terms including “Mdivi‐1”, “DRP1 inhibitor”, or “mitochondrial division inhibitor” in conjunction with “age‐related macular degeneration”, “retinal degeneration”, “retina”, or “RPE” identified clinical trials that indicate clinical interest in mitochondrial‐targeted strategies for retinal diseases (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). While direct clinical studies using Mdivi‐1 for treating dry AMD have not been reported, its promising effects in models of neurodegeneration and other forms of retinal injury, such as those observed in radiation‐induced optic neuropathy that affect retinal ganglion cells (Rong et al., 2020), provide a rationale for its repurposing in dry AMD. Furthermore, studies in non‐ocular cellular models, especially in neuronal N2a cells, demonstrate that treatment with Mdivi‐1 results in a decrease in mitochondrial fragmentation and an improvement in mitochondrial bioenergetics, outcomes that could translate to retinal cell preservation (Manczak et al., 2019).

Mechanism of Action:
The primary mechanism of action of Mdivi‐1 is its inhibition of Drp1, a dynamin‐related GTPase that orchestrates mitochondrial fission (Manczak et al., 2019; Smith & Gallo, 2017). Drp1 translocates to the outer mitochondrial membrane where it oligomerizes into ring‐like structures that constrict the membrane to facilitate fission. Under conditions of oxidative stress and in various degenerative pathologies, dysregulated Drp1 activity leads to excessive mitochondrial fission, fragmentation, and subsequent mitochondrial dysfunction. Mdivi‐1 inhibits Drp1’s enzymatic GTPase activity, reducing its ability to oligomerize and drive fission, which in turn promotes a shift towards mitochondrial fusion (Manczak et al., 2019). In several studies, treatment with Mdivi‐1 has resulted in a decrease in mRNA and protein levels of mitochondrial fission markers such as Drp1 and Fis1, while simultaneously increasing the expression of mitochondrial fusion regulators such as Mfn1, Mfn2, and Opa1 (Manczak et al., 2019). Additionally, Mdivi‐1 has been shown to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis, evidenced by upregulation of markers such as PGC‐1α, NRF1, NRF2, and TFAM (Kaarniranta et al., 2018; Manczak et al., 2019). There is also evidence from biochemical studies that at lower concentrations (around 25 µM), Mdivi‐1 improves the activity of mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) complexes (complexes I, II, and IV) and enhances mitochondrial respiration, while higher doses (75 µM) can be toxic, reducing ATP production and increasing oxidative markers (Manczak et al., 2019). Moreover, some studies have suggested that additional beneficial effects of Mdivi‐1 might be mediated by its capacity to modulate complex I–dependent respiration and reduce ROS production through interference with reverse electron transport (Bordt et al., 2017; Ruiz et al., 2018). This multi‐faceted mechanism not only helps to preserve mitochondrial network integrity but also appears to enhance mitochondrial quality control through promotion of mitophagy and overall bioenergetics, which are critical for the survival and proper function of energy‐demanding cells (Kaarniranta et al., 2019).

Expected Effect:
In the context of dry age‐related macular degeneration (dry AMD), the hypothesis is that Mdivi‐1 will preserve mitochondrial network integrity in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells. Given that mitochondrial dysfunction, excessive ROS production, and impaired autophagy contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of dry AMD, the expected effect of Mdivi‐1 involves several interrelated outcomes. Firstly, by inhibiting Drp1‐dependent mitochondrial fission, Mdivi‐1 should reduce aberrant mitochondrial fragmentation in RPE cells, thereby preserving mitochondrial morphology and function (Kaarniranta et al., 2018; Manczak et al., 2019). This preservation is critical because RPE cells rely on a robust mitochondrial network for the energy requirements associated with the phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments—a process that, when impaired, contributes to dry AMD pathology (Kaarniranta et al., 2018). Secondly, the reduction in mitochondrial fragmentation is expected to lower the production of mitochondrial ROS, reducing oxidative stress and subsequent cellular senescence in RPE cells (Manczak et al., 2019; Ruiz et al., 2018). Thirdly, the pharmacological action of Mdivi‐1 may enhance bioenergetics by improving the function of ETC complexes, leading to increased mitochondrial ATP production at optimal dosages, which supports both normal cellular metabolism and energy‐demanding processes such as autophagy (Manczak et al., 2019). Finally, by stabilizing mitochondrial dynamics, Mdivi‐1 may facilitate autophagy‐dependent phagocytic clearance of damaged photoreceptor outer segments by RPE cells, potentially reducing the accumulation of lipofuscin and other oxidative byproducts that are hallmarks of dry AMD (Kaarniranta et al., 2019; Cueva‐Vargas et al., 2025). In summary, the expected therapeutic effect of Mdivi‐1 in the proposed assay is to preserve RPE function by enhancing mitochondrial quality control, reducing oxidative stress, and supporting the phagocytosis mechanism necessary for retinal homeostasis—all of which could contribute to slowing the progression of dry AMD (Hyttinen et al., 2018).

Overall Evaluation:
Based on the comprehensive literature review, Mdivi‐1 emerges as a promising candidate for repurposing as a therapeutic for dry AMD, primarily through its impact on mitochondrial dynamics. The compound’s strengths include a well‐characterized mechanism targeting Drp1, which is central to the regulation of mitochondrial fission (Manczak et al., 2019). In several preclinical models—though mostly neuronal or non‐retinal—the benefits of Mdivi‐1 in preserving mitochondrial network integrity, reducing excessive ROS production, and enhancing bioenergetics have been clearly demonstrated (Manczak et al., 2019). These properties are highly relevant to RPE cells, which require efficient mitochondrial function for the energy‐intensive process of phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments and for maintaining retinal health (Kaarniranta et al., 2018; Kaarniranta et al., 2019). The proposed mechanism of action aligns with the current understanding that mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are crucial drivers of dry AMD, and interventions that restore mitochondrial homeostasis could be beneficial (Hyttinen et al., 2018).

However, there are several weaknesses and gaps that remain. First, most of the direct biochemical evidence for Mdivi‐1 comes from studies in neuronal cell lines (e.g., N2a cells) rather than in RPE cells or directly in models of retinal degeneration (Manczak et al., 2019). This raises questions regarding the translational potential of these findings to ocular tissues. Although the underlying mitochondrial pathways are conserved across cell types, the unique metabolic environment and phagocytic requirements of the RPE necessitate dedicated studies. Second, there is a narrow therapeutic window for Mdivi‐1, with evidence showing that higher concentrations (e.g., 75 µM) can lead to toxicity, including decreases in ETC activity and ATP production (Manczak et al., 2019). This necessitates careful dosing and further pharmacokinetic studies to ensure safety, especially for chronic treatment in conditions like dry AMD. Third, while related clinical trials and preclinical studies underscore the potential of targeting mitochondrial dysfunction in retinal diseases, direct clinical evidence for the use of Mdivi‐1 specifically in dry AMD is lacking (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Kaarniranta et al., 2018). Additionally, some controversy exists regarding the specificity of Mdivi‐1’s mechanism of action—for instance, whether its protective effects are solely due to inhibition of Drp1 or also involve off‐target modulation of complex I–dependent respiration and ROS production (Bordt et al., 2017; Smith & Gallo, 2017). This uncertainty underlines the need for further mechanistic studies in retinal cell models.

Despite these limitations, the overall evaluation suggests that Mdivi‐1 has notable potential as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry AMD due to its capacity to restore mitochondrial quality control. Its strengths lie in the molecular rationale that preserving mitochondrial integrity could mitigate oxidative stress, enhance bioenergetics, and support the autophagy‐dependent clearance of damaged outer segments in RPE cells—processes that are fundamentally disrupted in dry AMD (Kaarniranta et al., 2018; Manczak et al., 2019). The fact that Mdivi‐1 has been previously used in numerous preclinical studies and has known dosing profiles in rodent models adds to its appeal for further testing and translational research (Manczak et al., 2019; Hyttinen et al., 2018). However, before progressing to clinical trials for dry AMD, it will be necessary to perform targeted preclinical studies in RPE‐specific and retinal degeneration models to assess not only efficacy but also the long‐term safety and appropriate dosing regimens of Mdivi‐1 in ocular tissues (Kaarniranta et al., 2019; Manczak et al., 2019).

In conclusion, Mdivi‐1 offers a promising strategy to address the mitochondrial dysfunction implicated in dry AMD. Its ability to inhibit Drp1‐mediated mitochondrial fission, reduce oxidative damage, and promote mitochondrial biogenesis aligns well with the therapeutic needs of maintaining RPE cell function and photoreceptor health. While preclinical evidence from neuronal and other cellular models provides a strong mechanistic foundation, additional studies focusing on retinal cells and in vivo AMD models are required to fully validate its viability as a treatment for dry AMD. Overall, the balance of evidence supports further investment in Mdivi‐1 as a repurposed drug candidate for dry AMD, with particular attention to optimizing dosage to maximize efficacy while minimizing potential mitochondrial toxicity (Manczak et al., 2019; Kaarniranta et al., 2018; Rong et al., 2020).
