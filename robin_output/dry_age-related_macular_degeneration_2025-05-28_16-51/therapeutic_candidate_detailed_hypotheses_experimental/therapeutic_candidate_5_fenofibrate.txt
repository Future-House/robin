Proposal for Fenofibrate (Tricor®, catalog F6020, Sigma-Aldrich)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Fenofibrate (marketed as Tricor® and available as catalog F6020 from Sigma-Aldrich) is a synthetic fibric acid derivative that belongs to the fibrate class of lipid-lowering agents, originally developed in the 1970s to treat dyslipidemia by reducing triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol while increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (Omae et al., 2012). This compound was discovered through efforts to manipulate lipid metabolism, and its chemical synthesis involves modification of the fibric acid scaffold to produce a drug capable of activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) (Omae et al., 2012). Fenofibrate belongs to a well-established therapeutic class whose members are known to modulate lipid metabolism, inflammation, and vascular function through nuclear receptor–mediated transcriptional regulation, and this class has widespread use for treating dyslipidemia and reducing cardiovascular risk (Abcouwer, 2012). Its mechanism of action, based on PPARα activation, has drawn attention for its potential impact on retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) dysfunction by enhancing lipid handling, promoting energy metabolism, and modulating inflammatory cascades relevant to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (Malek et al., 2010).

Therapeutic History:
Fenofibrate has an extensive clinical history spanning several decades of use in patients with abnormal lipid profiles, with a robust safety record established in hundreds of clinical studies addressing dyslipidemia and cardiovascular risk reduction (Omae et al., 2012). In addition to its approved indication for dyslipidemia, fenofibrate has been investigated in multiple clinical trials for its retinal protective effects in diabetic retinopathy, including well-known studies such as FIELD and ACCORD-eye, where it demonstrated the ability to reduce the progression of diabetic retinal disease (Kataoka et al., 2023; Tomita et al., 2020). Although fenofibrate has not been directly approved or widely used for the treatment of dry AMD, several clinical trials and preclinical studies have evaluated its effects on retinal diseases—for example, fenofibrate has been a component of studies monitoring retinal inflammation and vascular permeability, with several trials (e.g., NCT00683176, NCT03345901, NCT03439345) primarily focused on diabetic retinopathy and macular edema (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2008, 2018). Preclinical studies have further explored its potential in models of neovascular AMD, particularly through its effects on pathological angiogenesis and inflammation in the retina, although the direct evidence for its use in dry AMD remains limited (Lee et al., 2023). As such, prior evidence supports fenofibrate’s ability to protect retinal tissues in conditions where dysregulated lipid metabolism and oxidative stress are contributory factors, forming a biochemical rationale for its repurposing in dry AMD (Qiu et al., 2017).

Mechanism of Action:
Fenofibrate exerts its therapeutic effect primarily by activating the nuclear receptor PPARα, which upon ligand binding dimerizes with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) and binds to specific PPAR response elements (PPREs) in target genes to regulate their transcription (Malek et al., 2010). This activation leads to upregulation of genes involved in fatty acid β-oxidation, lipid efflux, and overall energy metabolism, thereby reducing intracellular lipid accumulation and the associated oxidative stress that is a hallmark of RPE dysfunction in dry AMD (Wang et al., 2023). Besides enhancing lipid metabolism, fenofibrate has been shown to stimulate autophagy, the cellular process that degrades and recycles damaged proteins and organelles, which is critical for maintaining RPE homeostasis and efficient photoreceptor outer segment clearance (Wang et al., 2023). Furthermore, preclinical data indicate that fenofibrate can improve phagosome–lysosome fusion—a key step in RPE-mediated clearance of aged photoreceptor outer segments—through its PPARα-mediated effects on gene expression and possibly via modulation of downstream signaling pathways such as PI3K/AKT (Wang et al., 2023; Tomita et al., 2020). Additionally, fenofibrate’s anti-inflammatory properties include inhibition of NF-κB activation and reduction in the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, thus reducing retinal inflammation and contributing to improved RPE function (Qiu et al., 2017; Abcouwer, 2012). Collectively, these molecular interactions suggest that fenofibrate is capable of improving RPE lipid handling and autophagy while attenuating lipotoxicity—a critical process in the pathogenesis of dry AMD (Lee et al., 2025).

Expected Effect:
In the context of dry AMD, the hypothesis posits that fenofibrate will enhance the RPE’s ability to clear photoreceptor outer segments by improving lipid handling and stimulating autophagy. This is expected to occur through the upregulation of genes responsible for fatty acid oxidation and lipid efflux, thereby reducing lipid overload and accumulation of toxic lipid deposits that impair RPE function (Malek et al., 2010; Qiu et al., 2017). In experimental assays, fenofibrate is anticipated to increase the efficiency of phagosome–lysosome fusion in RPE cells, which is essential for proper degradation of photoreceptor debris; this effect is mediated by PPARα activation and potentially supported by the modulation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathways that are known to be active in RPE cells (Wang et al., 2023; Tomita et al., 2020). The compound’s established anti-inflammatory activity may further reduce oxidative stress and chronic inflammatory responses in the retina, thereby preserving RPE integrity and function over time (Qiu et al., 2017; Omae et al., 2012). Given that RPE cells express high levels of PPARα and that dysregulation of lipid metabolism is implicated in AMD pathophysiology, the expected outcome is an overall improvement in RPE homeostasis with subsequent retardation of dry AMD progression (Kataoka et al., 2023). This mechanistic specificity distinguishes fenofibrate from nonspecific anti-inflammatory agents and underscores its potential as a targeted therapeutic strategy to restore the balance of lipid turnover and autophagy in the RPE (Lee et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
Fenofibrate has several compelling strengths as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry AMD. One of its major strengths lies in its long-standing clinical use and favorable safety profile as a lipid-lowering agent in dyslipidemia, which provides a robust platform for repurposing without the need for extensive preliminary safety studies (Omae et al., 2012; Kataoka et al., 2023). Its well-documented ability to activate PPARα and subsequently modulate key metabolic pathways—including fatty acid oxidation, lipid efflux, and autophagy—positions it as an attractive candidate for restoring defective RPE homeostasis that is central to dry AMD pathogenesis (Malek et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2023). Moreover, preclinical studies have demonstrated that fenofibrate can protect retinal cells by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, which are also implicated in the progression of dry AMD (Qiu et al., 2017; Tomita et al., 2020). Its oral availability and established pharmacokinetics further enhance its appeal in terms of patient compliance and ease of administration (Tomita et al., 2020).

However, there are notable weaknesses and gaps that warrant cautious consideration. To date, the majority of clinical and preclinical studies involving fenofibrate have focused on diabetic retinopathy and neovascular conditions rather than dry AMD specifically, meaning direct evidence supporting its efficacy in dry AMD remains limited (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2008, 2018). Additionally, while the mechanistic rationale linking PPARα activation to improved RPE lipid handling and autophagy is strong, the direct effects of fenofibrate on RPE phagosome–lysosome fusion and clearance of photoreceptor outer segments have yet to be conclusively demonstrated in dry AMD models (Wang et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2025). This gap underscores the need for further targeted studies—both in vitro using primary RPE cells and in vivo in animal models that recapitulate the pathophysiology of dry AMD—to fully validate the proposed mechanism. In addition, potential off-target effects, such as fenofibrate’s known renal excretion issues and other systemic adverse effects when used in high doses, might present challenges in a patient population that could be more vulnerable due to age and comorbidities (Omae et al., 2012; Tomita et al., 2020).

In summary, fenofibrate represents a promising repurposed drug candidate for dry age-related macular degeneration based on its established role as a PPARα agonist, its extensive safety and clinical history in dyslipidemia and diabetic retinopathy, and the compelling mechanistic rationale linking PPARα activation to improved lipid handling, enhanced autophagy, and reduced retinal inflammation. These factors collectively support the hypothesis that fenofibrate can restore RPE function by increasing fatty acid oxidation, promoting phagosome–lysosome fusion, and reducing lipotoxicity, ultimately enhancing the clearance of photoreceptor outer segments. Nonetheless, the absence of direct clinical data in dry AMD mandates additional preclinical studies to solidify this therapeutic concept before advancing to clinical trials in the dry AMD population (Lee et al., 2023; Kataoka et al., 2023). Overall, while fenofibrate’s repurposing for dry AMD is mechanistically sound and supported by indirect evidence, further research is essential to validate its efficacy and safety within this specific retinal pathology.
