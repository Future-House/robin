Proposal for Sulforaphane (catalog S4441, Sigma-Aldrich)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Sulforaphane (catalog S4441, Sigma-Aldrich) is a naturally occurring isothiocyanate originally isolated from cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli and Brussels sprouts. It is formed by the enzymatic hydrolysis of glucoraphanin by the plant enzyme myrosinase during mechanical processing (e.g., chopping or chewing), leading to the release of sulforaphane. This compound belongs to the class of phase 2 enzyme inducers, which function as indirect antioxidants by activating cellular defense mechanisms rather than directly scavenging free radicals. Sulforaphane’s chemical structure contains an electrophilic isothiocyanate group that allows it to modify specific cysteine residues on regulatory proteins, primarily Keap1, which in turn leads to the activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway. Historically, compounds in this class have been used extensively in chemoprevention research and have been explored for their anti-inflammatory, anticarcinogenic, and neuroprotective properties across various disease models (Zhang et al., 2024; Chang et al., 2020). Their use in preclinical studies has extended to models of oxidative stress in both systemic and ocular tissues, setting the stage for repurposing sulforaphane for diseases in which oxidative damage is central to pathogenesis.

Therapeutic History:
Sulforaphane has a well-established history as a dietary phytochemical known for its robust induction of antioxidant enzymes via activation of Nrf2. Its safety profile is excellent due to its natural dietary origin, and it has been evaluated in numerous preclinical studies as well as in several clinical trials for various cancers and systemic inflammatory conditions – though not directly for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) to date (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In experimental ocular studies, sulforaphane has been shown to protect the retina against light-induced damage and ischemia-reperfusion injury by upregulating cytoprotective genes in retinal cells, including the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), which is critically involved in the pathogenesis of dry AMD (Unknown Reference; Chang et al., 2020). Although clinical trial evidence supporting its efficacy specifically in dry AMD is absent, numerous in vitro and animal studies have demonstrated its potential to alleviate oxidative stress and inflammatory injury in RPE cells – a finding that is particularly relevant given the central role of RPE dysfunction in dry AMD (Bergandi et al., 2024; Sim et al., 2021). Prior work in non-ocular tissues as well as preclinical ocular models suggests that sulforaphane’s repurposing for dry AMD is scientifically plausible, particularly through its capacity to trigger endogenous antioxidant defenses and support cellular clearance mechanisms.

Mechanism of Action:
The key mechanism of action for sulforaphane lies in its ability to activate the Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2) signaling pathway. Under basal conditions, Nrf2 is sequestered in the cytoplasm through its interaction with Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), which facilitates its ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Sulforaphane, via its electrophilic isothiocyanate group, covalently modifies reactive cysteine residues on Keap1. This modification disrupts the Keap1–Nrf2 complex and prevents the degradation of Nrf2, thereby allowing it to accumulate in the cytoplasm and translocate into the nucleus (Chang et al., 2020; Kubo et al., 2017). Once in the nucleus, Nrf2 heterodimerizes with small Maf proteins and binds to the antioxidant response elements (ARE) in the promoter regions of a broad number of cytoprotective genes. This binding leads to the transcriptional induction of various phase II detoxification enzymes and antioxidant genes, including heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1), glutathione S-transferases, and others that contribute to reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and restoring redox homeostasis within cells.

In RPE cells, the induction of these genes is particularly critical because these cells encounter high levels of oxidative stress generated by light exposure, high metabolic activity, and phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments. The activation of Nrf2 by sulforaphane not only enhances the antioxidant capacity of the RPE cells but may also promote autophagy. Preclinical studies have suggested that increased Nrf2 activity can stimulate autophagic mechanisms, improving the clearance of damaged proteins and organelles – a key process to mitigate lipofuscin accumulation and enhance phagosome–lysosome fusion. Lipofuscin is a byproduct of inefficient degradation of photoreceptor outer segments and accumulates in RPE cells with age, contributing to the pathogenesis of dry AMD (Unknown Reference; Yang et al., 2021). In addition, sulforaphane has been observed to modulate inflammatory pathways, particularly through inhibition of NF-κB signaling, thereby reducing the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, and VEGF in a manner that may further mitigate AMD-associated inflammatory damage (Bergandi et al., 2024; Wang & Tang, 2022). Together, these mechanisms – Nrf2-dependent antioxidant responses, enhancement of autophagy, and suppression of inflammatory mediators – form the biochemical basis by which sulforaphane is hypothesized to exert therapeutic effects in the context of dry AMD.

Expected Effect:
Based on its well-characterized mode of action, sulforaphane is expected to exert a multifaceted protective effect in the RPE cells, which are central to the pathology of dry AMD. The primary expected outcome is the induction of Nrf2-dependent antioxidant enzymes, which will reduce oxidative stress and mitigate the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. This in turn is anticipated to prevent further damage to cellular components, such as proteins, lipids, and mitochondrial DNA, that would otherwise lead to cell dysfunction and degeneration (Chang et al., 2020; Pan et al., 2014).

In parallel, the activation of autophagy is expected to enhance the clearance of damaged and oxidized cellular constituents, including lipofuscin, which is a pigment granule that accumulates as a byproduct of inefficient lysosomal degradation of photoreceptor outer segments in RPE cells (Zhang et al., 2024; Lambros & Plafker, 2016). Enhanced autophagic flux should improve phagosome–lysosome fusion, leading to more effective degradation of cellular debris and maintenance of RPE cell homeostasis, which are crucial for supporting photoreceptor health and visual function.

The anticipated effect is also expected to include a reduction in the secretion of VEGF and other pro-inflammatory mediators, thereby potentially attenuating the local inflammatory environment that exacerbates RPE damage and contributes to the progression of dry AMD (Bergandi et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2021). Moreover, sulforaphane's preservation of mitochondrial function by preventing mitochondrial depolarization and maintaining ATP production is critical since compromised mitochondrial bioenergetics are a hallmark of RPE cell dysfunction in dry AMD (Chang et al., 2020; Unknown Reference). Given that RPE cells express Nrf2 at levels essential for redox regulation and survival, enhancing the Nrf2 pathway in these cells is expected to result in improved cellular resilience and a slower progression of dry AMD pathophysiology (Bergandi et al., 2024; Rowan et al., 2020).

Overall, in an experimental assay measuring RPE cell viability, oxidative stress markers, and lysosomal function, sulforaphane treatment is expected to lead to a significant reduction in oxidative stress-related damage, lower levels of lipofuscin accumulation, and improved clearance of photoreceptor outer segment debris. These changes would collectively contribute to maintaining or even restoring retinal homeostasis, delaying the degenerative processes characteristic of dry AMD (Sim et al., 2021; Unknown Reference).

Overall Evaluation:
In evaluating sulforaphane as a therapeutic candidate for dry age-related macular degeneration, several strengths and weaknesses become apparent.

Strengths:
• Natural Origin and Safety Profile: Sulforaphane is a naturally derived compound with an established safety profile due to its presence in commonly consumed vegetables. Its favorable toxicological and pharmacokinetic profiles have been confirmed in numerous clinical studies evaluating dietary isothiocyanates, lending significant translational appeal (Zhang et al., 2024; Kubo et al., 2017).
• Mechanistic Specificity: Sulforaphane has a well-understood mechanism of action centered on the activation of the Nrf2 pathway through Keap1 modification. This leads to a robust induction of a battery of cytoprotective, antioxidant, and phase II detoxifying enzymes. It also appears to modulate inflammatory signaling and promote autophagy, which are critical processes in rescuing RPE function in the face of age-related oxidative stress (Chang et al., 2020; Unknown Reference).
• Preclinical Evidence: A substantial body of preclinical evidence supports the ability of sulforaphane to reduce oxidative damage in retinal cells and protect against experimental models of retinal injury and degeneration. This includes evidence from both in vitro studies using ARPE-19 cells and in vivo animal models that simulate aspects of dry AMD pathology (Unknown Reference; Sim et al., 2021).
• Blood–Retina Barrier Permeability: Research indicates that sulforaphane exhibits favorable pharmacodynamic properties, including the capacity to cross blood–tissue barriers such as the blood–retina barrier. This enhances its suitability as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for ocular diseases like dry AMD (Zhang et al., 2024; Chang et al., 2020).

Weaknesses and Challenges:
• Lack of Direct Clinical Evidence: Despite promising preclinical data, there are currently no registered clinical trials or direct human studies evaluating sulforaphane for dry AMD. The translational gap from preclinical findings to clinical efficacy remains a crucial hurdle that must be addressed in future studies (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Bergandi et al., 2024).
• Dosing and Formulation Issues: Optimal dosing regimens remain to be defined for ocular applications. Although sulforaphane has been administered safely in various systemic contexts, determining a formulation that achieves therapeutic concentrations within the retina without systemic side effects is critical. This may require innovative drug delivery approaches to overcome challenges posed by low water solubility and rapid metabolism (Zhang et al., 2024; Luján et al., 2022).
• Mechanistic Gaps in Autophagy Induction: While there is promising data suggesting that Nrf2 activation by sulforaphane may stimulate autophagy, direct evidence of enhanced autophagosome–lysosome fusion and improved outer segment clearance in RPE cells remains limited. Additional mechanistic studies utilizing models of lipofuscin accumulation and autophagic flux will be necessary to bolster this component of the hypothesis (Unknown Reference; Yang et al., 2021).
• Reliance on Preclinical Models: Many of the supportive data are derived from cellular models or rodent studies that, while encouraging, may not fully recapitulate the complexities of human dry AMD. Extrapolation of these findings to human disease requires caution, and further validation in higher-order preclinical models is imperative (Bergandi et al., 2024; Pan et al., 2014).

Overall, sulforaphane represents a compelling therapeutic candidate for dry AMD due to its multifaceted mechanism of action – primarily Nrf2-dependent antioxidant activity, potential induction of autophagy, and suppression of pro-inflammatory mediators – all of which are critically implicated in the pathogenesis of dry AMD. Its natural origin, established safety as a dietary component, and supportive preclinical data position it as a strong candidate for repurposing. However, significant challenges remain, including the need for targeted clinical trials, optimization of dosing and formulation for ocular delivery, and further mechanistic validation of its effects on autophagic clearance in RPE cells. In light of these findings, the development team should consider advancing sulforaphane into further preclinical studies that focus on ocular-specific models and begin formulation work to enable subsequent early-phase clinical studies that address these critical translational gaps (Unknown Reference; Chang et al., 2020; Sim et al., 2021).
