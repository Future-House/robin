Proposal for Sitagliptin (Januvia®, catalog S4023, Sigma-Aldrich)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Sitagliptin (Januvia®, catalog S4023, Sigma-Aldrich) is a small‐molecule, orally active dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 (DPP-4) inhibitor originally synthesized for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. It was discovered through a rational drug design approach aimed at stabilizing the active incretin hormones, particularly glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), by preventing their enzymatic degradation. Sitagliptin belongs to the class of DPP-4 inhibitors, a group of therapeutics that prolongs the half-life of endogenous incretins, thereby enhancing insulin secretion and suppressing glucagon release. In clinical practice, this class of compounds is primarily used for glycemic control; however, their favorable safety profile and broad tissue distribution have spurred interest in repurposing them for conditions beyond diabetes (Gonçalves, 2016; Simó & Hernández, 2024).

Therapeutic History:
Sitagliptin’s established clinical use in type 2 diabetic patients is well documented, with extensive biochemical and clinical studies confirming its efficacy and safety as a glycemic control agent. Beyond its role in the pancreatic islets, several preclinical and early clinical studies have explored the extrapancreatic benefits of DPP-4 inhibitors, particularly in the retina. In diabetic retinopathy models, sitagliptin has been shown to preserve retinal neuronal function, reduce inflammatory markers, and maintain blood–retinal barrier integrity, all of which are key pathological features in a spectrum of retinal diseases. Notably, clinical and preclinical studies have evaluated the effects of DPP-4 inhibitors on retinal endothelial cells, retinal neuroprotection, and vasculature stabilization (Gonçalves, 2016; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2013). While sitagliptin itself has not been directly trialed in patients with dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the mechanistic overlap between diabetic retinopathy and dry AMD—in particular, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) dysfunction, oxidative stress, and inflammation—suggests a strong translational rationale for its repurposing (Gonçalves, 2016; Li et al., 2025).

Mechanism of Action:
The primary mode of action of sitagliptin is the inhibition of DPP-4, an enzyme that rapidly degrades incretin hormones such as GLP-1. By blocking DPP-4, sitagliptin prolongs the active state of GLP-1, leading to enhanced stimulation of the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) present in multiple tissues, including the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Activation of the GLP-1R is known to engage several intracellular signaling cascades, prominently the cyclic AMP (cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway, which promotes cellular survival, exerts anti-inflammatory effects, and enhances cellular functional processes such as phagocytosis. In the context of dry AMD, a key pathological hallmark is the decline of RPE-mediated phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments—a process that is vital for retinal homeostasis. The hypothesis is that by prolonging endogenous GLP-1 levels, sitagliptin indirectly stimulates GLP-1R on RPE cells, thereby upregulating cAMP/PKA signaling. This signaling cascade is proposed to enhance the expression and activity of molecules such as MER tyrosine kinase (MERTK) and integrins, both of which are critical for the integrin-dependent phagocytic clearance of shed photoreceptor outer segments. Although direct evidence on MERTK/integrin-mediated phagocytosis modulation by sitagliptin specifically in RPE cells is still emerging, the established pharmacology of GLP-1R activation supports improved phagocytic function in several cellular models (Gonçalves, 2016; Puddu & Maggi, 2022). Moreover, ocular penetration studies in experimental models have documented that sitagliptin can reach retinal compartments, thereby providing the necessary drug bioavailability at the site of action (Simó & Hernández, 2024; Ramos et al., 2024).

Expected Effect:
In the context of the proposed application for dry AMD, the expected effect of sitagliptin is to enhance RPE function and improve the phagocytic clearance of photoreceptor outer segments. Specifically, by raising endogenous levels of GLP-1 via DPP-4 inhibition, sitagliptin is anticipated to activate GLP-1R on RPE cells, leading to the stimulation of the cAMP/PKA signaling cascade. This intracellular signaling is pivotal in upregulating molecules such as MERTK and integrins that mediate the phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments—a critical process that is compromised in dry AMD. Furthermore, GLP-1R activation is linked to anti-inflammatory and antioxidative pathways, which could help mitigate the chronic oxidative stress and inflammatory milieu characteristic of dry AMD. The RPE has been shown to express GLP-1 receptors (as evidenced by immunohistochemical studies referenced in related diabetic retinopathy research) and is responsible for the daily turnover of photoreceptor outer segments; maintenance of this function is essential to retinal health (Gonçalves, 2016; Puddu & Maggi, 2022). Thus, the assay proposed—to measure changes in phagocytosis, expression of MERTK, integrin levels, and related signaling molecules in RPE cells—should demonstrate that sitagliptin treatment leads to enhanced phagocytic activity, reduced inflammatory cytokine production, and improved cellular survival markers. The expected overall outcome is a restoration of RPE function, decreased accumulation of debris in the subretinal space, and mitigation of the degenerative processes that underlie dry AMD progression (Leote, 2023; Gonçalves, 2016).

Overall Evaluation:
Sitagliptin presents several compelling strengths as a therapeutic candidate for dry AMD. First, its established safety profile in diabetic patients, combined with decades of clinical use and regulatory approval, makes it an attractive candidate for repurposing with a lower barrier to clinical translation (Gonçalves, 2016; Li et al., 2025). Second, the mechanism of enhancing endogenous GLP-1 levels to subsequently stimulate GLP-1R-mediated cAMP/PKA signaling offers a mechanistically specific approach that directly targets a known deficiency in dry AMD: the impaired phagocytic activity of RPE cells. The hypothesis that upregulation of MERTK and integrin-dependent pathways can restore phagocytic function is underpinned by extensive biochemical data in diabetic retinopathy models where similar pathways are implicated (Gonçalves, 2016; Puddu & Maggi, 2022). Third, there is preclinical evidence from diabetic retinopathy studies demonstrating that DPP-4 inhibitors like sitagliptin confer neuroprotective and vascular-stabilizing benefits in retinal tissues independent of systemic glycemic control, suggesting that similar mechanisms might protect against the neurodegenerative and inflammatory elements of dry AMD (Gonçalves, 2016; Ramos et al., 2022).

Nevertheless, several challenges and weaknesses must be considered. One potential issue is the extent and consistency of ocular penetration by sitagliptin. Although some studies have documented its ability to reach retinal compartments following topical administration, definitive pharmacokinetic studies in human ocular tissues are limited. This raises questions about whether therapeutically effective concentrations can be reliably achieved in the RPE (Simó & Hernández, 2024; Ramos et al., 2024). In addition, while diabetic retinopathy models provide a useful proxy, they differ in key aspects from the pathogenesis of dry AMD. Diabetic retinopathy involves significant vascular leakage and inflammation, whereas dry AMD is characterized predominantly by RPE degeneration, drusen accumulation, and geographic atrophy. Although there is some mechanistic overlap, the specific microenvironment and progression of dry AMD may require tailored dosing and delivery strategies (Gonçalves, 2016; Li et al., 2025). Furthermore, certain data in the literature suggest that DPP-4 inhibitors can have adverse effects on retinal endothelial cells in some experimental settings—such as an increase in vascular leakage via the SDF-1α/CXCR4/Src/VE-cadherin pathway—which could pose risks if similar mechanisms occur in human ocular tissues (Lee et al., 2016; Jäckle et al., 2020). However, it is important to note that the pathophysiological context in dry AMD is different from that in diabetic retinopathy, and the vascular concerns may be less pertinent in a non-neovascular, atrophic disease setting.

Another consideration is the translational gap between preclinical models and human disease. While the mechanistic rationale is robust, direct clinical evidence supporting the use of sitagliptin in dry AMD is currently lacking. Most available studies involve diabetic retinopathy models, and while these models share certain aspects of RPE dysfunction and inflammation with dry AMD, the disease etiologies are not identical. Additional comprehensive preclinical studies using dry AMD-specific models and subsequent phase I/II clinical trials will be necessary to validate the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin when repurposed for this indication (Gonçalves, 2016; Li et al., 2025).

On the mechanistic front, while the hypothesis posits that GLP-1 elevation and subsequent cAMP/PKA signal activation leads to upregulation of phagocytic machinery in RPE cells, the direct evidence for upregulation of MERTK and integrin-dependent phagocytosis by sitagliptin remains somewhat indirect. Most supporting data come from studies in diabetic retinopathy models and in vitro experiments that assess the protective and anti-inflammatory effects of incretin-based therapies (Puddu & Maggi, 2022; Gonçalves, 2016). Detailed biochemical studies specifically focused on RPE phagocytic function, including measurement of MERTK expression and integrin activation after sitagliptin treatment, would further strengthen the case for repurposing this agent for dry AMD.

In summary, sitagliptin shows promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry AMD due to its well-characterized mechanism as a DPP-4 inhibitor, its potential to enhance GLP-1-mediated neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory signaling in RPE cells, and its documented safety in diabetic populations. Its strengths lie in the mechanistic specificity of incretin signaling modulation and favorable systemic safety, while its weaknesses are primarily linked to uncertainties regarding ocular pharmacokinetics, disease-specific translational efficacy, and potential adverse vascular effects observed in some models. Overall, further targeted preclinical studies focusing on dry AMD-specific pathology and subsequent early-phase clinical trials will be critical to validate the therapeutic potential of sitagliptin in this context (Gonçalves, 2016; Simó & Hernández, 2024; Ramos et al., 2024).
