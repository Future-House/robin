Proposal for Resveratrol (catalog R5010, Sigma-Aldrich)

Below is a comprehensive evaluation of resveratrol (catalog R5010, Sigma-Aldrich) as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD). The evaluation is organized into five sections: an overview of the candidate’s origins and class, its therapeutic history, its mechanism of action in molecular detail, the expected cellular and tissue-level effects in RPE cells (the critical cell type in dry AMD), and an overall evaluation highlighting strengths and weaknesses.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Resveratrol is a naturally occurring polyphenolic stilbene that was originally isolated from grape skins and red wine. Its chemical structure, 3,5,4′‐trihydroxy-trans-stilbene, was characterized during early investigations into natural compounds with antioxidant and anti‐aging properties. As a member of the polyphenol class, resveratrol has been shown to exhibit broad pleiotropic effects—including anti-inflammatory, anticancer, cardioprotective, and neuroprotective properties—which have been extensively explored in preclinical studies. In addition to its natural abundance, synthetic and semisynthetic methods have made resveratrol accessible for research applications. Compounds of this class have traditionally been used to mitigate oxidative stress and promote cellular longevity in a variety of organ systems. Their known ability to activate key regulators of metabolism and stress responses, such as SIRT1, places them at the forefront of efforts to protect cells from age‐related degeneration. This has generated significant interest in repurposing resveratrol for retinal diseases, particularly those characterized by chronic oxidative stress and compromised autophagy, such as dry AMD (Bola et al., 2014; Delmas et al., 2021).

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic history of resveratrol spans preclinical biochemical studies, animal models, and early-phase clinical trials. Previously, resveratrol has been evaluated in multiple clinical trials for metabolic syndromes and cardiovascular conditions, where it demonstrated improvements in insulin sensitivity, reductions in systemic inflammation, and favorable shifts in oxidative stress biomarkers. In the ocular realm, several preclinical investigations have focused on its protective effects in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, which are crucial to maintaining central retinal health. For example, experimental studies have documented that resveratrol prevents oxidative stress–induced mitochondrial dysfunction in RPE cells by preserving mitochondrial membrane potential and reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (Bilbao-Malavé et al., 2021). Further, animal studies have shown that resveratrol treatment is associated with improved retinal structure and function, including enhanced photoreceptor survival in models where RPE oxidative damage is a central feature. Although clinical studies thus far have primarily investigated resveratrol’s impact on exudative (wet) AMD—as evidenced by trials such as those registered under NCT04756310 and NCT05062486—the underlying mechanistic targets (enhancement of autophagy, improvement of mitochondrial quality, and reduction of oxidative damage) are precisely those that are disrupted in dry AMD. In conditions such as dry AMD, where chronic oxidative stress leads to RPE degeneration and accumulation of toxic photoreceptor debris, repurposing resveratrol is especially appealing since its history of ocular protective effects strongly suggests it could be beneficial for this indication (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2014; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021).

Mechanism of Action:
Resveratrol’s potential in dry AMD is largely based on its well‐characterized mechanism of action as an activator of SIRT1, an NAD⁺-dependent deacetylase that modulates a host of cellular processes tied to aging, stress resistance, and mitochondrial homeostasis. At the molecular level, resveratrol has been shown to enhance the deacetylation of critical regulators such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) and certain Forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors. The deacetylation of PGC-1α is directly responsible for upregulating mitochondrial biogenesis and increasing the expression of endogenous antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase. In addition to directly modulating SIRT1, resveratrol activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key cellular energy sensor that, upon activation, suppresses mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). The inhibition of mTORC1 relieves its suppressive effects on autophagy, thereby enhancing the autophagic flux necessary for the clearance of damaged organelles and aggregated proteins. In the context of RPE cells, these dual actions are critical: enhanced mitochondrial function supports the high energy demands of photoreceptor outer segment phagocytosis, while improved autophagy via increased fusion of phagosomes with lysosomes facilitates the clearance of photoreceptor debris. Moreover, resveratrol has been documented to reduce the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as interleukin-8) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) through modulation of pathways including MAPK/ERK signaling. This anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic activity further contributes to the stabilization of the retinal microenvironment, potentially curtailing any low-grade inflammatory drive that exacerbates RPE degeneration (Josifovska et al., 2020; Koskela et al., 2016; Bilbao-Malavé et al., 2021). Furthermore, studies indicate that SIRT1 activation by resveratrol can promote beneficial epigenetic modifications and maintain DNA methylation stability, which indirectly supports RPE cell longevity (Delmas et al., 2021; Kaarniranta et al., 2018). Altogether, the coordinated activation of SIRT1 and AMPK by resveratrol initiates a multipronged cellular defense: it boosts mitochondrial biogenesis, promotes the degradation of damaged cellular components via autophagy, and reduces oxidative and inflammatory insults—all of which are crucial for safeguarding RPE cell function under stress conditions typical of dry AMD (Bilbao-Malavé et al., 2021; Nita & Grzybowski, 2023).

Expected Effect:
Based on its mechanism of action, the hypothesis is that resveratrol administration will have several beneficial outcomes in RPE cells, which can translate into clinical benefits for patients with dry AMD. First, by activating SIRT1 and AMPK, resveratrol is expected to enhance mitochondrial biogenesis and preserve mitochondrial membrane potential. RPE cells, which are tasked with the substantial metabolic burden of daily photoreceptor outer segment phagocytosis, require highly robust mitochondrial function to meet their energy needs. Improved mitochondrial function would thus help these cells resist oxidative damage and delay the onset of mitochondrial dysfunction—a known contributor to dry AMD pathology (Kaarniranta et al., 2018). Second, the promotion of autophagic flux by resveratrol through mTOR inhibition is anticipated to result in an increased rate of phagosome–lysosome fusion, which is essential for clearing toxic debris from photoreceptor outer segment turnover. In cell-based assays, one would expect to observe an increase in the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II along with a reduction in p62 levels, indicating enhanced autophagic degradation. These changes would correlate with a decrease in lipofuscin accumulation and other markers of oxidative damage in the RPE (Pinelli et al., 2023).

Additionally, resveratrol’s anti-inflammatory effects should lead to a measurable decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-8, as well as a reduction in VEGF levels. This anti-inflammatory milieu is expected to help stabilize the local retinal environment, reducing the chronic low-grade inflammation that contributes to RPE degeneration in dry AMD (Bola et al., 2014; Nagineni et al., 2014). Experimental models simulating light-induced oxidative stress have further corroborated resveratrol’s ability to protect retinal cells by blocking both caspase-dependent and PARP-dependent cell death pathways. For instance, under conditions mimicking the high oxidative burden of the retina, treatment with resveratrol has resulted in improved photoreceptor survival and preserved outer nuclear layer thickness in animal studies, suggesting that similar protective effects could be harnessed in RPE cells (Subramani et al., 2017; Tong et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2018).

At the level of a cell assay, one would expect that an RPE culture treated with resveratrol will show improved mitochondrial parameters (e.g., increased membrane potential and ATP production), enhanced autophagic markers (e.g., elevated LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, decreased p62), and reduced oxidative stress markers (e.g., lower levels of ROS and malondialdehyde). In addition, gene expression analyses may reveal downregulation of inflammatory mediators and upregulation of antioxidant enzymes. Collectively, these changes should contribute to improved cell survival and function, ultimately mitigating the degenerative processes observed in dry AMD (Kaarniranta et al., 2018; Luján et al., 2022; Nita & Grzybowski, 2023; Pinelli et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
Considering the extensive preclinical evidence and the mechanistic rationale, resveratrol emerges as a promising candidate for repurposing in dry AMD therapy. One of its significant strengths is the dual activation of the SIRT1 and AMPK pathways, which has been consistently shown to improve mitochondrial homeostasis and stimulate autophagic clearance in various cell types, including RPE cells. Such effects directly address major defects in dry AMD, namely chronic oxidative damage, accumulation of toxic photoreceptor debris, and RPE dysfunction secondary to compromised autophagy (Delmas et al., 2021; Kaarniranta et al., 2018).

Another notable strength is resveratrol’s anti-inflammatory profile. By downregulating key mediators like IL-8 and VEGF, resveratrol helps to create a retinal microenvironment less prone to inflammation. Even though dry AMD is typically characterized by the absence of overt neovascularization, low-grade inflammation remains a driving force in the progression of RPE degeneration. Thus, the inhibition of pro-inflammatory signaling pathways adds an additional protective benefit that could slow the disease course (Bola et al., 2014; Nagineni et al., 2014).

Moreover, several studies have shown that resveratrol is capable of promoting phagosome–lysosome fusion and enhancing the autophagic flux in RPE cells. This facet of its mechanism is particularly attractive because one of the hallmarks of dry AMD is the impaired clearance of photoreceptor outer segments, leading to lipofuscin accumulation and eventual cell dysfunction. Experimental data suggest that resveratrol-treated cells exhibit enhanced degradation of damaged organelles, correlating with improved cellular viability under conditions of oxidative stress (Josifovska et al., 2020; Koskela et al., 2016).

The safety profile of resveratrol further supports its potential repurposing. Clinical trials in non-ocular indications, including those for metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, have generally reported a favorable safety and tolerability profile, especially in the elderly—who form the primary population affected by dry AMD. While it is recognized that resveratrol suffers from low bioavailability when administered orally, ongoing research into novel delivery modalities (such as nanoparticle encapsulation, topical formulations, or intraocular implants) is producing promising strategies to overcome this pharmacokinetic barrier (Luján et al., 2022; Pinelli et al., 2023).

Nevertheless, there are challenges that must be acknowledged. Resveratrol’s rapid metabolism and low systemic bioavailability remain significant obstacles. Achieving therapeutically relevant concentrations in the retina after systemic administration is problematic; hence, optimizing ocular delivery methods will be a critical component of its further development. Additionally, while there is substantial preclinical evidence supporting its efficacy, direct clinical data in patients with dry AMD are still sparse. Although trials such as those registered under NCT04756310 and NCT05062486 have evaluated resveratrol-containing formulations in ocular disease contexts, the majority of robust efficacy data have so far been limited to animal models and in vitro studies (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2014; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021; Bilbao-Malavé et al., 2021).

Furthermore, the multifactorial nature of dry AMD poses an inherent challenge. Dry AMD arises from an interplay of genetic predispositions, environmental factors, and systemic metabolic derangements. It is improbable that a single therapeutic agent, regardless of its potent mechanistic effects, will be sufficient to reverse or halt all pathogenic processes in this complex disease. It is thus likely that resveratrol may ultimately need to be used in combination with other therapeutic agents—such as other antioxidants, anti-inflammatory drugs, or compounds that further augment autophagy—to achieve a clinically meaningful effect. Nonetheless, the fact that resveratrol can directly target several of the central pathogenic mechanisms gives it a strong rationale for continued research as part of a multimodal therapy approach (Delmas et al., 2021; Kaarniranta et al., 2018).

Another consideration is the translation of in vitro and animal model findings to the human clinical scenario. Differences in dosing, pharmacodynamics, and the long-term progression of dry AMD require that extensive clinical trials be conducted to fully characterize the therapeutic index and sustained efficacy of resveratrol in the human retina. It is also important to evaluate the impact of chronic administration, as dry AMD is a slowly progressive disease that may necessitate long-term treatment before tangible benefits are observed. Moreover, understanding the potential adverse interactions that might occur in complex treatment regimens for an elderly population is critical for overall drug development.

Despite these challenges, the multipronged benefits of resveratrol—encompassing improved mitochondrial biogenesis, enhanced autophagy, decreased oxidative stress, and anti-inflammatory actions—present a compelling rationale for its repurposing in dry AMD. Its mechanism of action directly addresses several pivotal failures in RPE cell function that contribute to the pathogenesis of dry AMD. The evidence from biochemical and preclinical studies supports the idea that resveratrol can restore RPE homeostasis by promoting the clearance of photoreceptor debris and by mitigating the chronic oxidative and inflammatory damage that undermines retinal health (Bilbao-Malavé et al., 2021; Nita & Grzybowski, 2023; Pinelli et al., 2023).

In summary, from a drug development perspective, resveratrol represents an attractive candidate for repurposing in dry AMD owing to its well-characterized activation of SIRT1 and AMPK, its demonstrated ability to enhance autophagic flux and mitochondrial quality, and its anti-inflammatory properties. The strengths of resveratrol lie in its multifaceted mechanism of action, which is precisely aligned with the major pathogenic processes in dry AMD, and its favorable safety profile observed in other clinical contexts. The primary weaknesses that need to be addressed are its low bioavailability and the current paucity of direct clinical evidence in dry AMD patients. Future research should be directed toward optimizing delivery methods to increase ocular exposure, conducting rigorous clinical studies to establish dosing regimens, and potentially evaluating combination therapies that leverage resveratrol’s mechanisms in synergy with other agents.

Overall, the current literature strongly supports further investigation into resveratrol as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry AMD. Its capacity to modulate key cellular survival and stress response pathways—especially the activation of SIRT1 and AMPK, enhancement of autophagic clearance, and improvement of mitochondrial function—forms a robust scientific foundation that justifies advancing resveratrol into targeted, hypothesis-driven clinical trials. With the appropriate formulation strategies to overcome pharmacokinetic limitations, resveratrol has the potential to address the multifactorial pathology of dry AMD and provide clinical benefit to patients suffering from this degenerative retinal disease (Bilbao-Malavé et al., 2021; Nita & Grzybowski, 2023; Pinelli et al., 2023).

This comprehensive evaluation, integrating data from biochemical studies, in vitro assays, animal models, and early-phase clinical investigations, underscores that resveratrol’s pleiotropic effects on key intracellular pathways make it an appealing candidate for addressing the complex pathophysiology of dry AMD. Continued research, with an emphasis on improving ocular bioavailability and validating long-term efficacy in well-designed clinical trials, will be crucial in determining whether resveratrol can fulfill its promising role in ameliorating RPE degeneration and preserving central vision in patients with dry AMD.
