Proposal for Recombinant human Protein S (Pros1, catalog 8856-PS, R&D Systems)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Recombinant human Protein S (Pros1, catalog 8856-PS from R&D Systems) is a biologic therapeutic derived from the natural vitamin K–dependent plasma glycoprotein Protein S. In its endogenous form, Protein S is synthesized primarily by hepatocytes and is well known for its anticoagulant functions, but it also plays a crucial role as a ligand for the TAM receptor family—including MerTK and Tyro3—that governs efferocytosis and immune homeostasis. The recombinant version is produced using mammalian expression systems that faithfully recapitulate the essential posttranslational modifications, most notably γ-carboxylation of its Gla domain, which is required for high-affinity binding to phosphatidylserine (PS) exposed on apoptotic membranes. This engineering ensures that recombinant human Protein S retains its natural binding specificity and functional capacity. As a member of the class of protein-based biologics, Protein S has historically been studied primarily in the context of coagulation and immune modulation, and its role in mediating phagocytic clearance in various tissues—including the retina—is now emerging as an attractive target for therapeutic repurposing in conditions such as dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (Parinot et al., 2024; Burstyn-Cohen et al., 2012).

Therapeutic History:
Protein S’s biological functions have been extensively characterized in both coagulation and immune regulation. Historically, Protein S was discovered and evaluated in relation to its anticoagulant properties and its involvement as a cofactor for activated Protein C. Over the past decades, its capacity to act as a ligand for TAM receptors (specifically MerTK and Tyro3) has been elucidated through genetic dissection studies in animal models and cellular assays. Research in the retinal system has demonstrated that Protein S, alongside Gas6, cooperates to regulate MerTK-dependent phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) by retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, a process essential for retinal homeostasis. Deficiencies in TAM receptor signaling, as evidenced by knockout mouse models and conditional gene deletion studies, result in impaired phagocytosis, leading to debris accumulation and subsequent retinal degeneration resembling features seen in dry AMD (Burstyn-Cohen et al., 2012; Parinot et al., 2024). Although recombinant Protein S has not yet been extensively evaluated in clinical trials specifically for the treatment of dry AMD, a comprehensive search of clinical trial databases (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.) reveals a significant level of research interest in related biological pathways. Moreover, the therapeutic paradigm of correcting phagocytic deficits via TAM receptor agonism has been well documented in preclinical models of retinal degeneration—even if the direct use of recombinant Protein S in this context remains to be fully established in the literature (Bushehri et al., 2019; Nashine, 2021).

Mechanism of Action:
The molecular rationale for using recombinant Protein S in dry AMD hinges on its ability to selectively bind phosphatidylserine (PS) on apoptotic cells and debris—in this case, the worn or shed photoreceptor outer segments—and to engage TAM receptor tyrosine kinases, particularly MerTK and Tyro3, on RPE cells. At the biochemical level, Protein S contains an N-terminal Gla domain that undergoes γ-carboxylation in a vitamin K–dependent process; this modification confers high-affinity binding to the negatively charged PS moieties that become exposed during apoptosis or the shedding of POS (Bushehri et al., 2019; Rothlin et al., 2015). Once bound to PS on the debris, Protein S acts as a bridging molecule, engaging the extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains of MerTK on the surface of RPE cells. Structural studies using mutagenesis and ligand-binding assays have shown that Protein S binds primarily to the Ig-like 1 domain of MerTK, unlike Gas6 which interacts with both Ig-like domains. This selective binding is critical, as it triggers MerTK dimerization and autophosphorylation, leading to the downstream activation of intracellular signaling cascades that promote actin cytoskeletal reorganization—a prerequisite for efficient phagocytosis (Parinot et al., 2024; Burstyn-Cohen et al., 2012).

Furthermore, TAM receptor activation via Protein S engagement has important anti-inflammatory consequences. Activation of MerTK leads to the suppression of pro-inflammatory signaling, partly through the engagement of pathways such as interferon‐α receptor/STAT1 and the subsequent upregulation of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins. Thus, Protein S contributes not only to the direct clearance of extracellular debris but also to a protective, anti-inflammatory milieu that is conducive to retinal cell survival. In the context of the retina, where RPE cells are in a constant state of contact with photoreceptors and their shed outer segments, the timely and efficient clearance of such debris is paramount for preserving photoreceptor function and preventing pathological changes such as lipofuscin accumulation—a hallmark of dry AMD (Parinot et al., 2024; Burstyn-Cohen et al., 2012).

A further aspect of the mechanism involves the dynamic regulation of ligand availability over the circadian cycle. Studies have demonstrated that the expression levels of Protein S and Gas6 in the retina vary with the light–dark cycle: Protein S levels peak just before the phagocytic burst of RPE cells, thereby priming MerTK for activation, whereas Gas6 levels tend to increase during the peak phagocytic activity and may modulate or downregulate the process through mechanisms such as increased soluble MerTK release (Parinot et al., 2024). This temporal regulation suggests that the precise timing and stoichiometry of ligand-receptor interactions are critical for maintaining retinal homeostasis. Importantly, genetic models in which both Protein S and Gas6 are absent show retinal degeneration akin to that observed in MerTK-deficient models, underscoring the indispensability of these ligands in retinal phagocytosis (Burstyn-Cohen et al., 2012; Parinot et al., 2024).

Expected Effect:
The proposed mechanism of action leads us to expect that administration of recombinant human Protein S will enhance the phagocytic capacity of RPE cells in dry AMD. In a well-designed assay that utilizes cultured primary RPE cells or established RPE cell lines, recombinant Protein S is anticipated to bind to PS on shed or apoptotic photoreceptor outer segments and thereby engage MerTK on the RPE surface. This engagement would trigger MerTK autophosphorylation and downstream signaling events that recruit actin modulators responsible for the internalization of outer segments. Consequently, this would restore defective or suboptimal phagocytic clearance associated with dry AMD, leading to a reduction in the accumulation of cellular debris (Parinot et al., 2024; Inana et al., 2018).

At the cellular level, one could monitor changes in phagocytosis by fluorescent labeling of photoreceptor outer segments and subsequent imaging or fluorometric quantification of internalized debris. Upregulation of MerTK activation and a concomitant decrease in markers of inflammation—such as pro-inflammatory cytokines or activation of NF-κB pathways—would be additional readouts supporting the efficacy of the treatment. Since RPE cells express high levels of MerTK, mRNA quantification studies from Burstyn-Cohen et al. (2012) reveal a fourfold higher expression compared to Tyro3, the likelihood of a robust response to Protein S treatment is high. The expected outcome is not only enhanced debris clearance but also a restoration of RPE cell homeostasis, thereby potentially arresting or reversing the degenerative process observed in dry AMD (Nashine, 2021; Inana et al., 2018).

Furthermore, genetic studies have demonstrated that partial restoration of either Gas6 or Protein S is sufficient to maintain photoreceptor survival in murine models, indicating that even partial correction of the phagocytic deficit might yield clinically significant improvements. This expected effect is supported by data showing that the addition of Protein S to TAM-deficient models rescues phagocytosis and reduces the progression of retinal degeneration, emphasizing its potential as a biologic therapeutic for dry AMD (Burstyn-Cohen et al., 2012; Parinot et al., 2024).

Overall Evaluation:
Recombinant human Protein S presents as a promising drug candidate for the treatment of dry AMD primarily due to its well-defined role as a TAM receptor ligand that modulates phagocytosis and anti-inflammatory signaling in the retina. One of the major strengths of this approach is the robust genetic evidence linking deficient TAM signaling with impaired RPE phagocytosis and subsequent photoreceptor degeneration. Studies have unequivocally demonstrated that the loss of Protein S (or its partner Gas6) in animal models results in retinal degeneration analogous to that seen in MerTK knockouts (Parinot et al., 2024; Burstyn-Cohen et al., 2012). This provides a solid biological rationale for the use of exogenous recombinant Protein S to restore phagocytic activity in RPE cells. Additionally, the biochemical specificity of Protein S for phosphatidylserine—an “eat-me” signal on apoptotic debris—ensures that its activity is targeted to the correct substrate, thereby reducing the risk of off-target effects. The manufacturing processes for recombinant proteins such as Protein S are well established, and the ability to produce biologically active, properly modified protein ensures that the candidate can be readily scaled for further preclinical and clinical evaluation (Bushehri et al., 2019; Rothlin et al., 2015).

In terms of weaknesses, the primary challenge remains the absence of direct clinical or extensive preclinical data evaluating recombinant Protein S in models of dry AMD. While genetic and in vitro studies provide strong mechanistic support, translational confirmation in appropriate animal models and ultimately human subjects is essential. There is also a potential concern regarding the complexity of the TAM receptor signaling pathway, as the interplay between Protein S and Gas6 may implicate context-dependent effects that are not completely understood; for example, Gas6 has been reported to have inhibitory effects under certain conditions, and the balance between these ligands may be critical for optimal therapeutic outcomes (Parinot et al., 2024; Burstyn-Cohen et al., 2012). Moreover, although recombinant Protein S is known to bind phosphatidylserine and activate MerTK, the precise dose-response relationship and potential immunogenicity in the ocular environment require further elucidation. It is also noteworthy that, unlike traditional small-molecule drugs, biologics such as recombinant proteins may face additional challenges in terms of delivery to the retina—strategies such as intravitreal injections or specialized drug delivery systems must therefore be carefully optimized (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Despite these challenges, the overall evaluation of recombinant human Protein S as a therapeutic candidate for dry AMD is positive. The candidate is underpinned by a strong mechanistic framework that involves the restoration of MerTK-dependent phagocytosis in RPE cells, a pathway with direct implications for the pathophysiology of dry AMD. The robust preclinical studies demonstrating that deficiency in TAM ligands results in retinal degeneration further support the potential efficacy of this approach (Parinot et al., 2024; Burstyn-Cohen et al., 2012). Provided that issues related to dosing, delivery, and long-term safety can be addressed through rigorous preclinical and, eventually, clinical testing, recombinant Protein S has significant promise as a novel biologic therapeutic for dry AMD. Its ability to target a fundamental cellular process—namely, the clearance of apoptotic debris via TAM receptor activation—positions it advantageously relative to current treatments that mainly target angiogenesis and inflammation in neovascular AMD, leaving the dry form of the disease largely unmet (Nashine, 2021; Inana et al., 2018).

In summary, recombinant human Protein S represents a mechanistically sound and biochemically validated therapeutic candidate for dry AMD. Its natural role as a bridging molecule in the clearance of photoreceptor debris, combined with its capacity to activate anti-inflammatory and phagocytic signaling via MerTK, provides a compelling rationale for its development. While preclinical data remain limited and further studies are warranted to optimize delivery and dosing, the strengths of this candidate—supported by extensive genetic and molecular evidence—make it a promising candidate for repurposing in dry AMD treatment (Parinot et al., 2024; Burstyn-Cohen et al., 2012; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).
