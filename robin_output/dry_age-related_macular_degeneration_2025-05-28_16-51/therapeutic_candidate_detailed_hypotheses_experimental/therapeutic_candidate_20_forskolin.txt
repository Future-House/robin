Proposal for Forskolin (catalog F6886, Sigma-Aldrich)

Below is a comprehensive evaluation of forskolin (catalog F6886, Sigma-Aldrich) as a repurposed drug candidate for dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD). This report is organized into five major sections: an Overview of the therapeutic candidate, its Therapeutic History, the Mechanism of Action in molecular detail, the Expected Effect in relevant assays, and an Overall Evaluation that discusses its advantages and challenges for treating dry AMD. The following discussion is based solely on the provided literature context.

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Forskolin is a naturally derived labdane diterpenoid that is extracted from the roots of Coleus forskohlii (also referred to as Plectranthus barbatus). Its discovery is rooted in ethnobotanical research where traditional Indian medicinal practices guided its identification and initial application (Alasbahi & Melzig, 2010, pp. 10–11). As a natural compound within the diterpene family, forskolin is characterized by its direct activation of adenylyl cyclase without the need for receptor binding, a quality that sets it apart from other cAMP modulators. This mechanism of direct activation allows forskolin to rapidly elevate intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels across a variety of cell types (Alasbahi & Melzig, 2010, pp. 8–9). In addition, its low molecular weight contributes to favorable tissue penetration properties, a crucial consideration when targeting ocular tissues where the localized increase of cAMP is desired without significant systemic exposure. Forskolin’s chemical class, consisting of plant‐derived diterpenoid natural products, has been historically utilized both as a biochemical tool and as a therapeutic lead in cardiovascular, metabolic, respiratory, and ocular domains (Alasbahi & Melzig, 2010, pp. 10–11).

Therapeutic History:
Over the years, forskolin has accumulated an extensive therapeutic history across multiple biomedical fields. In cardiovascular research, forskolin has been used to induce positive inotropic effects and vasodilatory responses; early studies demonstrated its ability to stimulate myocardial adenylyl cyclase activity, thereby improving coronary blood flow and overall cardiac performance (Melzig, 2012, pp. 2–3). Its application in metabolic disorders has also been explored because of its ability to stimulate lipolysis via upregulation of cAMP in adipose tissues, which has been correlated with improvements in insulin secretion and body composition. In the realm of respiratory medicine, forskolin’s bronchodilatory effects have been documented, largely attributed to its capacity to relax airway smooth muscle, thereby attenuating symptoms associated with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Alasbahi & Melzig, 2010, pp. 8–9). More notably, in ophthalmology forskolin has been evaluated in preclinical studies for its ocular hypotensive effects. Topical administration in animal models such as rabbits and monkeys has shown that forskolin can lower intraocular pressure by decreasing aqueous humor formation through cAMP elevation in the ciliary epithelium (Alasbahi & Melzig, 2010, pp. 10–11; Shivaprasad et al., 2014, pp. 5–6). Although forskolin has not been directly used in clinical studies for dry AMD, its inclusion in drug screening assays using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells under oxidative stress conditions suggests that researchers have begun to explore its potential in diseases that share underlying cellular dysfunctions with dry AMD (Chang et al., 2014, pp. 5–7). Additionally, its broad use across oncology, systemic inflammation, and neuroprotection further supports its pleiotropic nature, despite the lack of direct translational studies linking it to retinal degenerative disease states (Salehi et al., 2019, pp. 10–12).

Mechanism of Action:
Forskolin’s well-established mechanism of action centers on its direct, receptor-independent activation of adenylyl cyclase. Once forskolin binds to the enzyme, it converts ATP to cyclic AMP at a rapid pace, resulting in a sharp increase in intracellular cAMP levels (Alasbahi & Melzig, 2010, p. 11). This elevation in cAMP is pivotal because it directly leads to the activation of downstream effectors such as protein kinase A (PKA) and exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP (Epac) (Melzig, 2012, pp. 7–8). Activation of these effectors initiates a series of phosphorylation events that culminate in changes in gene expression, modulation of cellular metabolism, and rearrangement of the cytoskeleton. In the context of RPE cells, the increase in cAMP is particularly important for promoting phagosome formation through the reorganization of actin filaments. PKA activation drives the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton, thereby supporting phagocytic receptor trafficking and the efficient uptake of photoreceptor outer segments (Alasbahi & Melzig, 2010, p. 11). Furthermore, some studies suggest that cAMP elevation via forskolin can lead to the inhibition of Rho kinase activity. The suppression of Rho kinase further facilitates the necessary cytoskeletal changes required for efficient phagocytosis as well as vesicular trafficking (Jun et al., 2022, pp. 8–9; Salehi et al., 2019, pp. 4–6). In addition to these primary actions, forskolin-mediated cAMP elevation has been noted to indirectly reduce inflammatory cytokine expression and mitigate cellular stress responses, both of which may play a secondary role in protecting retinal tissue from progressive degeneration (Rusciano, 2024, pp. 12–14).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis for repurposing forskolin in dry AMD is based on its ability to elevate cAMP in RPE cells, thereby triggering the activation of PKA and Epac signaling pathways. In theory, when administered locally—through topical or intravitreal routes—forskolin would achieve sufficiently high concentrations in the RPE so as to stimulate adenylyl cyclase effectively. The resulting increase in intracellular cAMP would then activate the PKA and Epac pathways, which are known to promote actin cytoskeleton remodeling. Such remodeling is essential for the proper trafficking of phagocytic receptors on the surface of RPE cells, a process that underpins the uptake and degradation of photoreceptor outer segments (Alasbahi & Melzig, 2010, pp. 10–11). In this model, enhancing the phagocytic capacity of RPE cells would lead to more efficient clearance of shed photoreceptor debris. This effect is anticipated to reduce the accumulation of toxic lipofuscin and other cellular waste products in the subretinal space—a recognized contributor to the pathogenesis of dry AMD (Salehi et al., 2019, pp. 8–10).

In experimental assays utilizing iPSC-derived RPE models, forskolin is expected to serve a dual role. Not only should it enhance the mechanical aspects of phagocytosis by promoting cytoskeletal reorganization, but its ability to modulate inflammatory signaling may also help alleviate the chronic oxidative stress and low-grade inflammation observed in the degenerating retina (Chang et al., 2014, pp. 5–7). Previous studies have demonstrated that compounds promoting cAMP elevation are associated with increased phagosome formation in various cell types, and this mechanistic link supports the potential of forskolin to restore or enhance photoreceptor outer segment clearance in RPE cells (Salehi et al., 2019, pp. 8–10). Additionally, early pharmacokinetic evaluations in ocular studies indicate that forskolin can be delivered locally with minimal systemic absorption. For instance, topical application studies in animal models have reported that forskolin eye drops produce a significant increase in ocular cAMP levels and a corresponding reduction in intraocular pressure (Karri, n.d., pp. 18–20; Steinle et al., 2021, pp. 1–3). While these studies were focused on glaucomatous endpoints rather than RPE function, they provide proof-of-concept that forskolin reaches ocular tissues and modulates cAMP-dependent processes in situ.

Overall, in assays aimed at measuring phagocytic uptake in RPE cells, one would expect forskolin treatment to translate into enhanced receptor trafficking and phagocytosis efficiency. In turn, this improved cellular clearance mechanism may ameliorate one of the fundamental defects observed in dry AMD, thereby slowing disease progression and preserving retinal structure and function.

Overall Evaluation:
In evaluating forskolin as a repurposed candidate for dry AMD, several compelling strengths are immediately apparent. The molecular mechanism of forskolin is one of the most clearly characterized among natural compounds. Its ability to directly activate adenylyl cyclase and elevate intracellular cAMP provides a well-defined biochemical pathway that is directly linked to the activation of both PKA and Epac. Given that these pathways regulate actin cytoskeleton remodeling and receptor trafficking—processes essential to the phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments—the mechanistic rationale is robust (Alasbahi & Melzig, 2010, p. 11; Melzig, 2012, pp. 2–3).

Another key advantage lies in its previous use in ocular applications. Forskolin has been evaluated for its intraocular pressure-reducing effects in glaucoma studies, demonstrating that it can be administered via topical ocular routes with measurable local efficacy and minimal systemic adverse effects (Shivaprasad et al., 2014, pp. 5–6; Steinle et al., 2021, pp. 3–4). These findings support the feasibility of employing similar administration techniques—whether topical or via intravitreal injection—to achieve localized therapeutic concentrations in the retina and specifically the RPE.

Moreover, forskolin’s inclusion in iPSC-derived RPE drug screening assays under oxidative stress conditions highlights its potential relevance to dry AMD (Chang et al., 2014, pp. 5–7). Although direct evidence showing forskolin–mediated enhancement of photoreceptor outer segment phagocytosis in RPE cells is still forthcoming, the established link between cAMP elevation and phagosome formation provides a strong hypothesis that justifies further research.

Despite these strengths, several challenges must be addressed. First, a notable weakness is the current paucity of direct preclinical or clinical evidence specifically showing that forskolin improves RPE phagocytosis or retards retinal degeneration in dry AMD models. Most existing studies have addressed endpoints such as intraocular pressure reduction in glaucoma or cardiopulmonary effects, rather than retinal debris clearance (Pay, 2017, pp. 230–239; Chang et al., 2014, pp. 5–7). Therefore, dedicated RPE‐specific in vitro and in vivo studies are critical before moving forward.

A second challenge is the delivery of forskolin to the outer retina. Data indicate that topical application of forskolin results in only a small fraction penetrating ocular tissues—for example, topical dosing in rabbits revealed that only about 0.03% of applied forskolin reached deeper ocular tissues (Karri, n.d., pp. 18–20). Such low penetration rates could limit its therapeutic efficacy in the RPE unless advanced drug delivery systems (e.g., nanoparticle-based formulations or sustained-release intravitreal implants) are developed to optimize tissue exposure, while still being safe for ocular administration.

Another point of caution is related to the broad effects of cAMP elevation. Forskolin does not act exclusively in RPE cells; its global activation of adenylyl cyclase could potentially elicit off-target effects in other retinal cell types (e.g., photoreceptors, endothelial cells) if dosing is not carefully controlled. Such non-specific modulation of cellular function might compromise retinal integrity. Thus, rigorous pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies are necessary to define a dosing regimen that maximizes RPE-specific effects while minimizing any potential adverse events (Rusciano, 2024, pp. 22–23; Salehi et al., 2019, pp. 4–6).

Furthermore, while the molecular rationale of forskolin’s mechanism is well established, many of its beneficial effects in the context of dry AMD remain theoretical. Although increased cAMP levels are associated with enhanced phagocytosis via PKA/Epac activation, it has not yet been definitively demonstrated that these molecular events translate into meaningful improvements in photoreceptor outer segment clearance or slowing of AMD progression in either animal models or human patients (Rusciano, 2024, pp. 15–16; Salehi et al., 2019, pp. 12–13). This gap in the literature must be addressed with carefully designed experiments using human RPE cells and dry AMD animal models.

From a strategic perspective, the strengths of forskolin as a candidate include its well-characterized, direct mechanism of action via adenylyl cyclase and its preexisting ocular use in the context of glaucoma. Its low molecular weight and capacity for localized delivery provide an attractive opportunity for maintaining high concentrations in the target tissue, while its anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective effects from cAMP signaling may add further value in the multifactorial pathology of dry AMD (Rusciano, 2024, pp. 7–9; Salehi et al., 2019, pp. 8–10). Conversely, the lack of direct evidence in RPE-focused and dry AMD-specific models, as well as the challenges associated with ocular penetration and possible off-target actions, represent significant hurdles that would need to be overcome.

Given these considerations, as a drug development team leader, I recommend allocating resources to conduct targeted preclinical studies designed to:
• Examine the impact of forskolin on phagocytic receptor trafficking and actin cytoskeleton remodeling in human RPE cell cultures.
• Evaluate the enhancement of photoreceptor outer segment clearance in iPSC-derived RPE models.
• Conduct in vivo studies using animal models that accurately recapitulate the dry AMD phenotype to assess both efficacy and ocular pharmacokinetics.
• Explore advanced drug delivery strategies—such as nanoparticle encapsulation or sustained-release formulations—to improve tissue penetration and achieve sustained RPE exposure.

In summary, forskolin represents a scientifically well-grounded candidate for repurposing in dry AMD based on its clearly defined mechanism of elevating intracellular cAMP, activating downstream PKA/Epac pathways, and modulating the actin cytoskeleton—a process that is crucial for effective phagocytosis in RPE cells (Alasbahi & Melzig, 2010, pp. 10–11; Melzig, 2012, pp. 7–8). Although its historical usage has been primarily in cardiovascular, metabolic, respiratory, and glaucoma-related applications, the mechanistic parallels between these effects and the cellular dysfunction observed in dry AMD are compelling. With the proper optimization of delivery methods and rigorous preclinical evaluation, forskolin holds the potential to restore RPE phagocytic function, reduce toxic debris accumulation, and ultimately slow the progression of dry AMD.

Thus, while significant work remains to establish definitive efficacy and safety in the context of dry AMD, the convergence of its biochemical actions, established ocular penetration capabilities, and preexisting evidence from related ocular studies supports further investigation of forskolin as a promising candidate. I recommend proceeding with a concerted preclinical research program focused on RPE-specific endpoints and innovative drug delivery systems to fully assess the translational potential of forskolin for dry age‐related macular degeneration (Rusciano, 2024, pp. 15–16; Salehi et al., 2019, pp. 12–13; Alasbahi & Melzig, 2010, p. 8; Jun et al., 2022, pp. 8–9).

In conclusion, given forskolin’s natural origins, well-established mechanism of cAMP elevation via adenylyl cyclase activation, and its documented ocular effects, it offers a strong scientific rationale for repurposing as an enhancer of RPE phagocytosis in dry AMD. However, careful attention must be paid to optimizing the delivery to the outer retina and minimizing off-target effects. With further targeted preclinical work, forskolin could eventually progress to clinical trials, potentially offering a novel therapeutic approach for a condition with very limited treatment options.
