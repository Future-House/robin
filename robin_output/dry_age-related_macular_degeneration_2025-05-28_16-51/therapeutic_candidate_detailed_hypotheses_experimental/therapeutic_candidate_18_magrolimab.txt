Proposal for Magrolimab (Hu5F9-G4, clinical grade antibody)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Magrolimab (Hu5F9-G4) is a humanized monoclonal antibody originally developed to target CD47, a ubiquitously expressed transmembrane protein that functions as a “don’t eat me” signal. As a member of the immuno‐oncology class of therapeutics, it was discovered using platforms that focus on generating high‐affinity antibodies against antigens overexpressed by tumor cells, thereby enabling the immune system—primarily macrophages and dendritic cells—to recognize and phagocytose cancer cells that would otherwise evade clearance by expressing high levels of CD47 (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). This class of compounds has been extensively used in oncology, where agents targeting the CD47–SIRPα axis have shown promise in promoting the phagocytosis of malignant cells by blocking inhibitory signals; thus, the mechanism has been proven effective in reactivating innate immune clearance pathways in a variety of cancers (Bouwstra et al., 2022, pp. 5–6).

Therapeutic History:
Magrolimab has undergone significant clinical evaluation in hematologic malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Clinical trials have demonstrated that when administered with appropriate priming regimens to mitigate on‐target anemia and other off‐tumor effects, it can effectively promote the clearance of tumor cells via macrophage activation (Qu et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Sheng et al., 2024, pp. 6–8). To date, its use has been predominantly in oncology; however, emerging research in ocular and retinal biology has drawn parallels between the mechanisms driving tumor immune evasion and those that may underlie subretinal debris accumulation in dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Preclinical studies investigating the role of CD47 in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and photoreceptor homeostasis indicate that loss of CD47 expression or its blockade leads to enhanced phagocytosis—manifesting as the formation of melanophages and hyperreflective foci, both recognized as biomarkers for AMD progression (Augustin et al., 2023, pp. 1–2; Augustin et al., 2023, pp. 12–14). While these findings have not yet translated into direct clinical use of magrolimab for dry AMD, the precedent set by its oncological applications provides a valuable safety and mechanistic framework for considering its repurposing in this context.

Mechanism of Action:
Under normal circumstances, CD47 on RPE cells and photoreceptor debris binds to signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPα) on phagocytic cells, delivering an inhibitory “don’t eat me” signal that restricts engulfment. Magrolimab binds to CD47 with high affinity, thereby preventing its interaction with SIRPα and releasing the brake on phagocytosis (Wang et al., 2021, pp. 6–7). In oncology, this blockade leads to the activation of macrophage-mediated clearance of tumor cells, and preclinical retinal studies have shown that similar CD47 blockade can enhance the phagocytic removal of RPE-derived pigment and cellular debris (Augustin et al., 2023, pp. 12–14). The biochemical cascade initiated by CD47 blockade involves the elimination of inhibitory signals mediated through SIRPα’s intracellular immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs), which, when phosphorylated, dampen the phagocytic response. By preventing this phosphorylation cascade, magrolimab essentially “releases” the phagocytes, enabling them to clear debris even in the absence of additional “eat me” signals (Wang et al., 2021, pp. 10–11; Qu et al., 2022, pp. 1–2). It is important to note that while studies in retinal degeneration models—such as those conducted in Cd47‐deficient mice—demonstrate that loss of CD47 leads to the formation of melanophages and correlates with disease progression, the working hypothesis here is that controlled blockade of CD47 in a therapeutic window could improve the removal of subretinal deposits without precipitating further RPE damage (Augustin et al., 2023, pp. 15–17).

Expected Effect:
The central goal of repurposing magrolimab for dry AMD is to promote the efficient clearance of pathogenic subretinal deposits by modulating phagocytosis. In the context of dry AMD, accumulation of drusen and subretinal debris is a key pathological hallmark that contributes to chronic inflammation and RPE dysfunction. By interrupting the CD47–SIRPα interaction, magrolimab is expected to enhance the phagocytic activity of retinal macrophages and, possibly, RPE cells themselves, which have been shown to undertake phagocytosis in the healthy retina during outer segment renewal (Augustin et al., 2023, pp. 4–5; Beguier, 2018, pp. 137–138). The underlying hypothesis is that without the “don’t eat me” signal, these phagocytes will clear debris more effectively, leading to a reduction in hyperreflective foci and the overall burden of subretinal deposits—a mechanism that aligns with the therapeutic objectives for stopping or reversing the progression of dry AMD. Additionally, the molecular targets of magrolimab are expressed in relevant ocular cell types; CD47 is present on RPE cells and photoreceptors, and its decline with age or in AMD has been documented, which further supports the rationale for targeting this pathway (Augustin et al., 2023, pp. 14–15; Wang et al., 2021, pp. 6–7). There is also evidence from related studies showing that augmentation of CD47/SIRPα signaling can protect cones from degeneration by modulating immune cell activity (Wang et al., 2021, pp. 6–7), although this suggests that the exact timing and extent of CD47 modulation is critical; thus, the desired therapeutic modulation might aim for a balanced blockade that enhances clearance without promoting excess phagocytosis of viable cells.

Overall Evaluation:
Magrolimab represents a promising candidate for repurposing in dry AMD based on its well‐established mechanism of action in oncology and emerging preclinical data supporting the role of the CD47–SIRPα axis in regulating retinal debris clearance. One of the major strengths of magrolimab is its clinical pedigree and the extensive safety data available from oncological trials, where the antibody has demonstrated manageable side effects with the use of priming dose strategies (Qu et al., 2022, pp. 1–2; Sheng et al., 2024, pp. 6–8). This wealth of clinical experience should facilitate the translation of the drug into ocular studies. Furthermore, the mechanistic rationale is robust, as the inhibition of the “don’t eat me” signal has been shown to promote phagocytosis in multiple experimental systems; in the retina, preclinical models indicate that reduced CD47 expression correlates with increased formation of melanophages and progression of AMD, suggesting that a controlled blockade may instead improve debris clearance (Augustin et al., 2023, pp. 1–2; Augustin et al., 2023, pp. 15–17).

However, several challenges and weaknesses must be carefully considered. First, the retinal context differs significantly from the tumor microenvironment, and the balance between beneficial debris clearance and harmful over-phagocytosis of healthy RPE cells is delicate. Some preclinical findings indicate that loss of CD47 on RPE cells can precipitate pathological clearance leading to RPE dysmorphia—a phenomenon that is thought to contribute to AMD progression (Augustin et al., 2023, pp. 14–15). Thus, dosing regimens, timing of administration, and drug delivery methods will be critical to avoid exacerbating retinal degeneration. Second, although magrolimab’s safety profile is documented in oncology, systemic administration may cause off‐target effects such as anemia, given the widespread expression of CD47 on red blood cells; local ocular delivery strategies might mitigate these risks, but such approaches require further development and validation (Bouwstra et al., 2022, pp. 5–6; Sheng et al., 2024, pp. 6–8). Third, there remains an unresolved issue regarding whether microglia/macrophage‐mediated clearance in the retina can function in a truly SIRPα‐independent manner or whether modulation of CD47 signaling inadvertently affects other immune‐regulatory circuits in the eye (Wang et al., 2021, pp. 10–11). Finally, while the overall biochemical and molecular rationale is supportive, direct preclinical studies in dry AMD models using magrolimab (or similar CD47 blockers) remain limited. Thus, additional in vivo studies in appropriate animal models of dry AMD are essential to fully ascertain the therapeutic window, efficacy, and potential adverse effects.

In summary, magrolimab—as an anti‐CD47 monoclonal antibody—has a compelling mechanistic basis for repurposing in dry AMD. It belongs to a proven class of immunotherapeutics that function by blocking a key phagocytosis checkpoint and has demonstrated clear efficacy in promoting cell clearance in cancer. Preclinical retinal studies have established an association between reduced CD47 signaling and enhanced formation of melanophages and subretinal debris accumulation, which has driven the hypothesis that careful inhibition of CD47 could instead foster efficient clearance of such deposits (Augustin et al., 2023, pp. 12–14; Augustin et al., 2023, pp. 15–17). Strengths of the candidate include its established clinical history in oncology, a well‐elucidated mechanism of action, and a strong biological rationale based on CD47 expression in the retina. Conversely, the challenges lie in precisely titrating the blockade to encourage clearance of debris without triggering excessive phagocytosis that could damage healthy RPE cells, as well as mitigating systemic side effects inherent to CD47‐targeting agents. Further preclinical studies using ocular‐specific delivery methods and refined dosing strategies will be necessary before initiating human trials in dry AMD. Overall, while promising, magrolimab’s translation to ocular indications will require significant validation to ensure that the benefits of enhanced debris clearance outweigh the risks of overactive phagocytosis in the delicate retinal environment (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Augustin et al., 2023, pp. 1–2; Wang et al., 2021, pp. 6–7).
