Proposal for Siponimod (Mayzent®, catalog SML0766, Sigma-Aldrich)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Siponimod (Mayzent®, catalog SML0766, Sigma-Aldrich) is a synthetic small-molecule drug originally developed as a selective modulator of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptors, specifically targeting the S1P₁ and S1P₅ subtypes. It belongs to the class of S1P receptor modulators, compounds that are structurally designed to interact with the G-protein-coupled S1P receptors which play critical roles in immune cell trafficking, vascular homeostasis, and neuroprotection. The discovery of siponimod arose from efforts to develop compounds with a more selective receptor profile than its predecessor fingolimod (FTY720), emphasizing minimization of off-target effects such as cardiac bradycardia commonly associated with broader S1P receptor activity. Siponimod was synthesized by medicinal chemistry programs at companies such as Novartis and has been approved for the treatment of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS), leveraging its capacity to cross the blood–brain barrier and modulate central nervous system (CNS) S1P receptors (Goodman et al., 2019). The compound’s formulation and dosing have been optimized to ensure reproducible pharmacokinetics, facilitating predictable receptor engagement and safety profiles; indeed, its well-characterized PK profile and tunable dosing are a significant advantage when considering the repurposing of drugs into new therapeutic indications.

Therapeutic History:
Historically, siponimod has been used primarily in the treatment of multiple sclerosis, particularly in forms such as relapsing-remitting MS and secondary progressive MS. Its mechanism as an immunomodulator is underpinned by its ability to sequester lymphocytes in lymphoid tissues through selective agonism and functional antagonism at S1P₁, thereby reducing inflammatory damage within the CNS (Goodman et al., 2019; Park & Im, 2017). Preclinical studies have demonstrated its neuroprotective effects in animal models of MS and experimental glaucoma, where siponimod not only modulated immune cell trafficking but also directly acted on neuronal and glial cells to reduce neurodegeneration (Basavarajappa et al., 2023). In addition, studies in albino rabbits have confirmed its ocular bioavailability and safety after intravitreal injection, with pharmacokinetic profiles showing a favorable half-life and no significant retinal toxicity at tested doses (Alshaikh et al., 2024). Although siponimod’s clinical record to date is overwhelmingly based on its use for MS, there is emerging interest in repurposing it for ocular indications. The rationale for such repurposing comes from its known capacity to cross ocular barriers and modulate S1P receptor signaling pathways, which have been implicated in retinal homeostasis. Currently, there is no direct clinical application of siponimod for dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD); however, the existence of 33 relevant clinical trials in databases addressing siponimod in the context of retinal pigment epithelium dysfunction and AMD-related pathways suggests that the drug’s potential in this arena is being actively explored (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, siponimod acts as a selective agonist for S1P₁ and S1P₅ receptors. When activated, S1P₁ receptors lead to receptor internalization and subsequent inhibition of lymphocyte egress; however, beyond immunomodulation, S1P₁ signaling is crucial for maintaining endothelial integrity and promoting neuronal survival through activation of pro-survival signaling cascades such as Akt and extracellular signal–regulated kinase (Erk1/2) pathways (Goodman et al., 2019; Basavarajappa et al., 2023). S1P₅, while less extensively studied than S1P₁, is expressed on various neural cells and, importantly for repurposing in dry AMD, in retinal cells including the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Biochemical studies have implicated S1P signaling in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics, specifically actin remodeling, which is essential for phagocytosis—a process by which RPE cells clear photoreceptor outer segments (POS). Preclinical evidence in models of retinal disease suggests that S1P receptor modulation, particularly through S1P₅, influences the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and promotes the formation of phagosomes, thereby potentially rescuing phagocytic defects (Terao et al., 2019; Porter et al., 2018). Moreover, studies have noted that selective S1P₅ agonism can rescue phagocytosis in models where key phagocytic pathways are disrupted, such as in MERTK-deficient contexts where the clearance of shed photoreceptor outer segments is impaired—an effect that correlates with the hypothesized mechanism for alleviating dry AMD pathology (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Siponimod’s known ability to cross the blood–brain and potentially blood–retina barriers, along with its systemic safety profile, supports its use for directly modulating receptor activity in ocular tissues, thereby influencing both vascular function and intracellular phagocytic machinery without broadly suppressing the immune system (Yang et al., 2024; Alshaikh et al., 2024).

Expected Effect:
The underlying hypothesis driving the repurposing of siponimod for dry AMD is that selective activation of S1P₅ in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells will enhance their phagocytic activity towards photoreceptor outer segments, thereby clearing debris that accumulates in dry AMD and contributes to retinal degeneration. In healthy retinas, RPE cells perform a continuous and highly regulated process of phagocytosing the distal tips of photoreceptor outer segments, which is crucial for maintaining photoreceptor health and overall retinal homeostasis. Dysfunction in this process is a recognized contributing factor in the pathogenesis of dry AMD, leading to accumulation of metabolic waste, oxidative stress, and ultimately, RPE and photoreceptor cell death (Park & Im, 2017; Simón et al., 2019). Preclinical studies have suggested that S1P signaling, particularly via S1P₅ activation, can promote cytoskeletal rearrangements that are necessary for effective phagocytosis; this is likely driven by reorganization of actin filaments and increased formation of phagocytic cups, critical steps in the engulfment of photoreceptor debris (Terao et al., 2019; Porter et al., 2018). Therefore, when applied to an in vitro assay involving RPE cells, siponimod is expected to increase the clearance rate of photoreceptor outer segments by stimulating S1P₅-mediated reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and enhancing phagosome formation. Supporting this hypothesis, molecular studies have shown that S1P receptor expression, including that of S1P₅, is evident in RPE cells, and modulation of these receptors has been linked to improved cell survival and function (Terao et al., 2017; Simón et al., 2019). Additionally, the existing clinical experience with siponimod in other neurological settings provides evidence that its dosing can be finely tuned to achieve the desired therapeutic index without eliciting broad immunosuppression, a property that is particularly appealing for the treatment of chronic conditions such as dry AMD where long-term therapy is required (Goodman et al., 2019; Li et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
Siponimod presents a promising repurposing opportunity for the treatment of dry age-related macular degeneration through its selective modulation of S1P₁/₅ receptors. Among its strengths is the robust clinical and preclinical safety profile demonstrated in MS and ocular studies. Its ability to cross physiological barriers, including the blood–brain and likely the blood–retina barrier, coupled with predictable pharmacokinetics, enhances its suitability for long-term interventions in chronic conditions such as dry AMD (Alshaikh et al., 2024). The drug’s known mechanism of selectively modulating S1P receptors, with particular emphasis on S1P₅, aligns well with the therapeutic goal of enhancing RPE phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments. This approach addresses a validated pathogenic mechanism in dry AMD—the impaired clearance of extracellular debris—which leads to RPE dysfunction and subsequent photoreceptor degeneration (Park & Im, 2017; Simón et al., 2019). The detailed molecular interactions of siponimod, including receptor internalization and activation of intracellular signaling cascades (Akt, Erk1/2), have been well characterized in CNS and retinal models, suggesting that these same pathways could be leveraged to promote cytoskeletal reorganization in RPE cells (Goodman et al., 2019; Basavarajappa et al., 2023).

On the downside, one potential challenge is the possibility of ocular adverse events, such as macular edema, which have been documented with other S1P receptor modulators and in limited cases with siponimod itself (Li et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2024). It will be essential to establish dosing regimens that maximize the beneficial effects on RPE function while minimizing any risks related to vascular permeability or inflammation in the retina. Furthermore, despite the promising preclinical rationale, direct evidence linking siponimod to enhanced RPE phagocytosis in dry AMD models remains limited. Additional targeted studies, both in vitro with RPE cell assays and in vivo in animal models of dry AMD, are necessary to confirm that S1P₅-mediated signaling can indeed rescue phagocytic defects without triggering unwanted immunosuppressive effects (Terao et al., 2019; Porter et al., 2018). The existing literature provides a strong biochemical and pharmacological rationale for evaluating siponimod in this new setting, yet translational gaps remain that must be addressed before clinical application.

In summary, siponimod’s known ocular bioavailability, well-established clinical safety in MS, and detailed mechanism of S1P receptor modulation combine to present a compelling case for its repurposing as a therapeutic candidate for dry AMD. The drug’s ability to target S1P₅ receptors in RPE cells represents a novel approach toward restoring outer segment clearance and maintaining retinal homeostasis. However, while the data supporting its mechanism in neuroprotection and modulation of cytoskeletal dynamics are promising, further direct studies addressing its impact on RPE phagocytosis and retinal function in AMD-specific models are necessary to fully validate this approach. Overall, siponimod exhibits significant potential as an innovative and mechanistically rational candidate that warrants continued evaluation for the treatment of dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Goodman et al., 2019; Li et al., 2023).
