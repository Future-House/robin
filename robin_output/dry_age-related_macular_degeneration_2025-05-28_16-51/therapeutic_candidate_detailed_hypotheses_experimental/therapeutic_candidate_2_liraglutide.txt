Proposal for Liraglutide (Victoza®, catalog L4400, Sigma-Aldrich)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Liraglutide (Victoza®, catalog L4400, Sigma-Aldrich) is a synthetic, long-acting analogue of the human incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Chemically, it is based on the native GLP-1 peptide but modified via acylation and amino acid substitutions to confer resistance to dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) degradation and extend its half-life to approximately 13 hours. Originally discovered and subsequently developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, liraglutide belongs to the class of GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists, which have been used for glycemic control and weight reduction in diabetic and obese patients (Mouhammad et al., 2022). The synthesis of liraglutide involves recombinant DNA technology and peptide chemical modification, making it a biologically derived product that has also been adapted for long-term therapeutic use. This same class of compounds has historically been used for metabolic regulation, and emerging evidence indicates that the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties of GLP-1R agonists may be exploitable in other conditions, including neurodegenerative and retinal diseases (Puddu & Maggi, 2022).

Therapeutic History:
Liraglutide was initially approved for type 2 diabetes and later for obesity, with an established safety profile in systemic clinical use. Over the past decade, numerous studies have investigated the pleiotropic effects of GLP-1R agonists beyond glycemic control. In preclinical models, agents such as exendin-4 and liraglutide have shown neuroprotective effects in models of Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and diabetic retinopathy (Bao et al., 2015; Mouhammad et al., 2022). Though the majority of clinical data relate to diabetes and cardiovascular endpoints, recent exploratory studies have examined the ocular effects of GLP-1R agonists. For example, topical administration of GLP-1 agonists in diabetic rodent models has demonstrated protection against retinal neurodegeneration without impacting blood glucose levels, thus suggesting a localized effect on retinal tissues (Hernández et al., 2016). However, a search on ClinicalTrials.gov using the terms “liraglutide AND macular degeneration” has returned no registered studies, indicating that no direct clinical investigation has been performed regarding liraglutide treatment in dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Despite the absence of direct clinical trials targeting dry AMD, the substantial body of preclinical and biochemical literature—ranging from neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory mechanisms to evidence of GLP-1R expression in ocular tissues—lays the groundwork for considering liraglutide as a repurposed therapy in dry AMD (Mouhammad et al., 2022; Márquez, 2016).

Mechanism of Action:
Liraglutide exerts its effects by binding to and activating the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that, upon activation, preferentially couples to the Gαs subunit. This coupling promotes activation of adenylate cyclase and an increase in intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. Elevated cAMP, in turn, activates protein kinase A (PKA) and other downstream effectors such as cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), ultimately leading to altered gene transcription and promoting cell survival, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidative responses (Bao et al., 2015).

In the context of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, several studies have confirmed the expression of GLP-1R and observed that activation of this receptor via agonists like liraglutide can lead to neuroprotective outcomes. Although direct evidence of enhanced phagocytic activity in RPE mediated by liraglutide remains preliminary, mechanistic insights derived from studies with exendin-4 and other GLP-1 analogues indicate that engagement of the cAMP/PKA pathway can upregulate the expression of phagocytic receptors such as MERTK and integrins. These receptors are critical for the actin-dependent engulfment of photoreceptor outer segments—a process that becomes impaired in dry AMD (Mouhammad et al., 2022; Puddu & Maggi, 2022). Additional insights from studies performed in other cell types suggest that activation of GLP-1R can lead to cytoskeletal rearrangements, enhancing the actin-dependent phagocytosis process (Sterling et al., 2021). Furthermore, the GLP-1R–cAMP/PKA signaling cascade modulates inflammatory cytokine production and oxidative stress responses, critical to preserving the function of RPE cells. In vitro data from macrophages and pancreatic β cells have provided evidence that GLP-1R activation is associated with the upregulation of genes involved in phagocytic function and cellular homeostasis, which supports the proposed mechanism in RPE cells (Bao et al., 2015; Puddu & Maggi, 2022).

It is important to note that while the direct demonstration of upregulated MERTK or integrin expression in RPE following liraglutide exposure is not fully established in the literature, the known downstream pathways of GLP-1R activation offer a compelling biochemical rationale. Activation of these signaling cascades may improve RPE phagocytosis by promoting actin-dependent engulfment—a process that is impaired in dry AMD. Thus, liraglutide’s mechanism of action, through sustained GLP-1R engagement, emulates neuroprotective signaling seen in other neurodegenerative diseases and offers the promise of targeted modulation of the RPE’s phagocytic machinery (Mouhammad et al., 2022; Márquez, 2016).

Expected Effect:
In the proposed therapeutic model, liraglutide is expected to enhance RPE function by specifically targeting and enhancing the phagocytic clearance of photoreceptor outer segment debris. The hypothesis is that activation of the GLP-1 receptor in RPE cells increases intracellular cAMP levels, thereby activating PKA. This activation leads to enhanced cytoskeletal dynamics that facilitate actin-dependent engulfment. Concurrently, the transcription of genes encoding for phagocytic receptors, such as MERTK and members of the integrin family, is anticipated to be upregulated. Efficient phagocytosis by RPE cells is critical for maintaining photoreceptor health and retinal integrity, and defects in this process are a key pathological mechanism underlying dry AMD (Márquez, 2016; Puddu & Maggi, 2022).

Preliminary in vitro data in other systems—including primary astrocytes and pancreatic β cells—support the notion that GLP-1R agonists can upregulate key phagocytic genes through the cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling cascade (Bao et al., 2015). If similar mechanisms are operative in RPE cells, liraglutide could restore or even enhance impaired phagocytic function, thereby reducing the accumulation of drusen and other debris characteristic of dry AMD. Moreover, by mitigating oxidative stress and inflammation—a process that is well documented with liraglutide treatment in neural tissues and retinal cells—the drug is anticipated to further protect the RPE from degeneration (Puddu & Maggi, 2022). Studies using topical administration in animal models have demonstrated that GLP-1R agonists can directly deliver neuroprotective benefits to retinal tissues independent of systemic glucose lowering (Hernández et al., 2016).

Given the established safety profile of liraglutide in human diabetic patients and its favorable tolerability in ocular preclinical models, the translation of these findings to a therapeutic setting in dry AMD appears promising. In summary, the expected effect is that liraglutide will restore RPE phagocytic function and improve the clearance of photoreceptor outer segments via enhanced GLP-1R–cAMP/PKA signaling, with secondary benefits from its anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic actions (Mouhammad et al., 2022; Puddu & Maggi, 2022).

Overall Evaluation:
Liraglutide presents as a highly promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of dry age-related macular degeneration due to several important strengths. First, its origin as a synthetic GLP-1R agonist with a long half-life offers a therapeutic advantage by providing sustained receptor engagement and biochemical activity. This extended activity may be critical in achieving persistent activation of the GLP-1R–cAMP/PKA signaling cascade in RPE cells, a pathway that is central to modulating phagocytic receptor expression and actin cytoskeletal rearrangements necessary for effective phagocytosis (Mouhammad et al., 2022). Second, the extensive clinical experience with liraglutide in type 2 diabetes and obesity means that its systemic safety profile is well documented, which is advantageous when considering repurposing for ocular applications (Mouhammad et al., 2022; Unknown Reference). Third, preclinical studies have provided compelling evidence that GLP-1R agonists confer neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects in the retina, especially when administered topically, making liraglutide potentially suitable for localized eye delivery with minimal systemic exposure (Hernández et al., 2016; Márquez, 2016).

However, there are certain weaknesses and areas of uncertainty that must be addressed to fully validate liraglutide’s applicability in dry AMD. One significant limitation is the relative paucity of direct experimental evidence specifically linking liraglutide to enhanced RPE phagocytosis. Although the hypothesis is underpinned by data from other cell types—including astrocytes and β cells—that demonstrate upregulation of phagocytic genes via GLP-1R activation (Bao et al., 2015), similar studies in primary human RPE cells that directly measure increases in MERTK, integrins, or actin-dependent engulfment are currently limited. Additionally, while the GLP-1 receptor has been detected in the retina and even in isolated RPE cell lines in some studies, there remains some debate regarding its expression levels and distribution in human retinal tissues, as conflicting reports have been published using different detection methods (Hebsgaard et al., 2018).

Furthermore, while the excellent tolerability and safety profile of liraglutide in diabetic patients provide reassurance, ocular-specific safety data—especially with respect to long-term topical administration—are still emerging. Preclinical studies suggest minimal retinal adverse effects, but the translation of these results to chronic human administration in a dry AMD population requires careful clinical investigation. Clinical trial data regarding the use of GLP-1R agonists in retinal diseases have largely focused on diabetic retinopathy, and although some literature reports neutral or even protective effects in diabetic cohorts (Hernández et al., 2016), direct evidence in a dry AMD context is lacking (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

In conclusion, liraglutide is a strong candidate for repurposing toward dry AMD based on its established mechanism of action through GLP-1R–cAMP/PKA signaling, its potential to upregulate phagocytic receptors and promote actin-dependent processes, and its well-characterized systemic safety profile. The strengths of liraglutide include its long half-life, potential for localized ocular delivery, and pleiotropic protective effects that include anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective actions. However, the weaknesses lie in the need for more direct experimental evidence in RPE cells, clarity regarding GLP-1R expression in human retinal tissues, and the necessity for dedicated clinical trials to assess its efficacy and safety in dry AMD. Given these factors, further preclinical studies focusing specifically on RPE phagocytosis and subsequent phase I/II clinical trials in a dry AMD population are warranted before a full translational pipeline can be established (Mouhammad et al., 2022; Puddu & Maggi, 2022; Hernández et al., 2016).
