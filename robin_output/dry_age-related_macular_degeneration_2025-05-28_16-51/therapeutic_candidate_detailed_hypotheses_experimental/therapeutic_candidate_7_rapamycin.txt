Proposal for Rapamycin (Sirolimus, catalog R0395, Sigma-Aldrich)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Rapamycin, also known as sirolimus (catalog R0395, Sigma-Aldrich), is a natural macrolide compound discovered as a product of the bacterium Streptomyces hygroscopicus isolated from soil on Easter Island. It belongs to the class of mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) inhibitors and has a well‐defined chemical structure characterized by a large lactone ring. Over the past decades, rapamycin has been extensively studied for its potent immunosuppressive and anti‐proliferative actions, and it has been repurposed for various clinical indications beyond its original use in transplantation and oncology. In the context of drug development for ocular conditions, its property as a selective inhibitor of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) forms the basis of its potential utility in diseases characterized by impaired autophagy. Rapamycin is currently being explored as a candidate to treat dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) specifically by relieving autophagy suppression in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. The compound’s pharmacokinetic profile, including its known drug–drug interactions and formulation properties, further supports its repurposing for ocular applications (Mei et al., 2022; Chang et al., 2022).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, rapamycin has been used in several therapeutic contexts owing to its immunomodulatory and anti‐proliferative properties. Clinically, it is used as an immunosuppressant in renal transplantation and has anti‐neoplastic activity in certain cancers. Its broad mechanism of action by targeting mTORC1 has led to its investigation in aging and neurodegenerative disorders. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that rapamycin activates autophagy and exerts protective effects in central nervous system models of neurodegeneration, and its effectiveness in reducing age‐related cellular senescence has been validated in various animal studies (Kaarniranta et al., 2013; Kolosova et al., 2012). In the ophthalmologic arena, rapamycin has been evaluated in several retinal degeneration models. Multiple preclinical studies have shown that rapamycin improves cellular clearance mechanisms in RPE cells, reduces oxidative stress, and ameliorates morphological and functional degeneration in animal models of retinal degeneration and dry AMD (Chang et al., 2022; Falcão et al., 2024). In addition, intravitreal and subconjunctival formulations of sirolimus have been assessed in early-phase clinical trials for conditions such as uveitis and geographic atrophy—a late-stage manifestation of dry AMD—demonstrating a favorable ocular safety profile (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2006; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2008). Although clinical efficacy in dry AMD has yet to be definitively established, the compound’s consistent pharmacological behavior across multiple systems and disease models positions it well for further evaluation in this context.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, rapamycin exerts its effects primarily through binding the intracellular protein FKBP12. The resulting FKBP12-rapamycin complex interacts with mTORC1, which is a central regulator of cell growth, protein synthesis, and autophagy. Under nutrient-rich conditions, mTORC1 phosphorylates key proteins (such as ULK1 and TFEB), thereby suppressing autophagy by inhibiting the formation of autophagosomes and blocking lysosomal biogenesis. In the setting of dry AMD, hyperactivation of mTORC1 in the RPE has been linked to impaired autophagy, diminished clearance of damaged organelles, and reduced phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments (POS), ultimately contributing to lipofuscin accumulation and RPE dysfunction (Kaarniranta et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2019).

Rapamycin’s mechanism of inhibiting mTORC1 leads to a restoration of autophagic flux by relieving the phosphorylation-dependent block on autophagy. This results in the increased formation of autophagosomes and facilitates the subsequent fusion with lysosomes—a process termed phagosome–lysosome fusion—that is essential for the degradation and clearance of cellular debris, including the continuously ingested POS by RPE cells (Falcão et al., 2024). Moreover, inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin activates transcription factors such as TFEB, which upregulate the expression of genes required for lysosomal biogenesis and function. In turn, an enhanced lysosomal compartment improves the degradation of photoreceptor outer segments and mitigates the accumulation of toxic aggregates like lipofuscin, a hallmark of dry AMD pathology (Falcão et al., 2024; Chang et al., 2022). In addition, rapamycin’s effects on autophagy and inflammation are interconnected: by promoting autophagy, rapamycin indirectly decreases the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and suppresses the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, thereby further protecting RPE cell function (Wang et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2019).

Expected Effect:
In the proposed therapeutic hypothesis for dry AMD, the primary expected effect of rapamycin administration is to reverse mTORC1 hyperactivity within the RPE. In a well–established in vitro setting of RPE cells, rapamycin is anticipated to restore autophagic flux, manifesting as an increased LC3-II/LC3-I ratio and a reduction in p62 levels, consistent with enhanced autophagosome formation and improved autophagosome–lysosome fusion (Falcão et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2015). This restoration should lead to enhanced clearance of phagocytosed photoreceptor outer segments, thereby decreasing the retention of lipofuscin-like granules in RPE cells and ultimately protecting against the degenerative processes associated with dry AMD. Specifically, improved clearance of outer segment debris is expected to reduce oxidative stress and inflammatory responses within the RPE layer, contributing to cellular survival and maintaining the homeostatic functions of the RPE (Chang et al., 2022; Falcão et al., 2024).

Additionally, because RPE cells are known to express key autophagy and phagocytosis proteins—including LC3, TFEB, and LAMP1—the reactivation of autophagy pathways by rapamycin is expected to directly influence these molecular targets (Falcão et al., 2024; Kaarniranta et al., 2013). The compound’s role in activating TFEB via dephosphorylation plays a critical part in the upregulation of lysosomal gene expression, which is essential for effective phagolysosomal clearance. Furthermore, by mitigating the accumulation of oxidized proteins and other toxic waste products within RPE cells, rapamycin is posited to decelerate the progression of retinal degeneration that typifies dry AMD. This mechanistic framework is supported by preclinical animal studies wherein rapamycin improved retinal morphology and function, notably in models of sodium iodate-induced retinal degeneration and other experimental paradigms (Zhao et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2019).

Overall Evaluation:
When considering rapamycin as a candidate therapeutic for dry age-related macular degeneration, several strengths emerge from the comprehensive review of biochemical, preclinical, and early clinical data. First, the mechanistic rationale for targeting mTORC1 in RPE cells is robust, as mTOR hyperactivation is directly linked to the suppression of autophagy and impaired phagocytosis—a critical component in the pathogenesis of dry AMD (Chang et al., 2022; Kaarniranta et al., 2013). The ability of rapamycin to restore autophagic flux, enhance lysosomal biogenesis, and thereby improve the clearance of photoreceptor outer segments is well documented in multiple independent studies (Falcão et al., 2024).

A further strength of rapamycin is its extensive therapeutic history, which includes successful application as an immunosuppressant and anti-proliferative agent. Its favorable pharmacological profile has facilitated its use in both systemic and localized settings, and early-phase ocular trials have demonstrated that intravitreal or subconjunctival administration of sirolimus is well tolerated in the eye (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2006; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2008). These findings provide an encouraging safety background for its proposed use in dry AMD. Moreover, the fact that rapamycin’s mechanism is highly specific—targeting mTORC1 without broadly suppressing other signaling cascades—offers mechanistic clarity that is appealing in a clinical scenario where off-target effects can be particularly detrimental.

Across numerous preclinical models of retinal degeneration, rapamycin has consistently demonstrated protective effects mediated by the activation of autophagy and suppression of inflammatory pathways. For example, studies have shown that treatment with rapamycin in animal models results in improved retinal pigment epithelium morphology and partial restoration of photoreceptor function, which suggests that the compound can modulate the cellular homeostasis within the retina in a manner that is highly relevant to the pathophysiology of dry AMD (Falcão et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2022). The expected therapeutic effect of enhanced clearance of POS via improved autophagosome–lysosome fusion is particularly compelling, as defective phagocytosis and accumulation of debris are known to be key contributors to AMD pathology (Falcão et al., 2024; Kaarniranta et al., 2013).

Nevertheless, there are significant challenges and potential weaknesses that temper enthusiasm for rapamycin in this indication. One major concern is the translation of promising preclinical results into meaningful clinical outcomes. Although early-phase ocular safety studies indicate that rapamycin is well tolerated, larger randomized controlled trials in patients with geographic atrophy—the advanced form of dry AMD—have yielded mixed results, with some studies reporting a lack of significant efficacy in halting disease progression or even showing adverse changes in retinal structure (Wang et al., 2022; Wong et al., 2013). These clinical observations underscore the complexity of mTOR signaling in the retina, where both underactive and overactive autophagy can be deleterious. The precise dosing, formulation, and delivery strategies necessary to achieve the optimal balance of autophagy activation without triggering harmful metabolic or inflammatory responses remain to be fully elucidated.

Another potential weakness lies in the systemic effects of rapamycin. Although local administration (intravitreal or subconjunctival injections) minimizes systemic exposure, rapamycin’s well-known metabolic and immunomodulatory effects still pose challenges in long-term therapy, especially given that patients with dry AMD are often elderly and may have comorbidities that could be exacerbated by these systemic actions (Kolosova et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2022). Additionally, while the compound’s ability to promote autophagy provides a clear mechanistic basis for its use, the precise impact on RPE-specific functions—particularly on phagocytosis of POS and the subsequent clearance processes—has not been conclusively demonstrated in clinical settings. Preclinical evidence certainly supports improved autophagic flux and lysosomal degradation in RPE cells (Falcão et al., 2024; Chang et al., 2022), but translating these findings to a measurable clinical benefit in patients with dry AMD presents an ongoing challenge.

Furthermore, variability in disease etiology among patients with dry AMD suggests that a “one-size-fits-all” approach may not be applicable. Dry AMD is a multifactorial disease influenced by genetics, oxidative stress, inflammation, and environmental factors, and while targeting mTORC1 is appealing because of its central role in modulating autophagy and cellular metabolism, it is likely that a combination of therapeutic strategies may be required to address the heterogeneous nature of the disease (Yang et al., 2019; Falcão et al., 2024). There is also the consideration that prolonged mTOR inhibition might lead to unintended consequences in cell survival pathways, as mTOR signaling is also involved in various adaptive stress responses. The dual role of autophagy, serving both protective and potentially detrimental functions depending on the context, further complicates the therapeutic landscape (Si et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2022).

In summary, rapamycin presents a promising mechanistic candidate for the treatment of dry AMD based on its ability to inhibit mTORC1, thereby restoring autophagic function and improving the clearance of photoreceptor outer segments in RPE cells. Its established history of use, well-characterized mechanism of action, and demonstrated preclinical efficacy in various retinal degeneration models provide strong support for its continued investigation in this context (Chang et al., 2022; Falcão et al., 2024; Kaarniranta et al., 2013). However, the transition from preclinical promise to clinical efficacy is far from straightforward. Mixed results in clinical studies, potential systemic side effects, and the inherent complexity of modulating autophagic pathways in a multifactorial disease like dry AMD necessitate careful optimization of dosing, delivery mechanisms, and likely combination strategies to achieve a measurable therapeutic benefit. In light of these considerations, while rapamycin is mechanistically attractive and supported by extensive biochemical and preclinical evidence, further clinical studies with refined formulations and clear biomarkers of autophagic modulation in the retina are needed to determine its ultimate utility as a treatment for dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2011; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2012; Wong et al., 2013).

Overall Evaluation:
Strengths of rapamycin for treating dry AMD include its robust mechanistic rationale; as rapamycin directly targets mTORC1, a central regulator of autophagy and RPE phagocytosis, it has the potential to restore impaired cellular clearance mechanisms that contribute to the accumulation of toxic debris in the retina. Its extensive therapeutic history and favorable ocular safety profile in early-phase trials add to its appeal. Moreover, preclinical studies consistently demonstrate improvements in autophagic flux, lysosomal function, and retinal morphology following rapamycin treatment, supporting its potential to decelerate or even reverse pathological changes in dry AMD (Chang et al., 2022; Falcão et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2015).

Conversely, weaknesses include the mixed clinical efficacy observed in geographic atrophy trials and the potential for adverse systemic and ocular effects associated with long-term mTOR inhibition. The heterogeneity of dry AMD and the complex, sometimes paradoxical role of autophagy in retinal physiology further complicate rapamycin’s clinical translation. Additionally, while extensive preclinical data support rapamycin’s ability to enhance autophagy, there remains a gap in direct clinical evidence confirming that this leads to improved RPE phagocytosis or enhanced clearance of photoreceptor outer segments in patients with dry AMD (Wang et al., 2022; Kaarniranta et al., 2013; Si et al., 2023). Thus, the overall evaluation suggests that rapamycin is a scientifically sound candidate with strong preclinical support but that its clinical utility in dry AMD will depend on further studies to optimize delivery, dosing, and patient stratification.

In conclusion, rapamycin holds considerable promise as a repurposed drug candidate for dry AMD by virtue of its well-characterized mTORC1 inhibitory actions that restore autophagic function and facilitate the clearance of toxic photoreceptor debris. However, given the complexities of AMD pathogenesis and the mixed outcomes in early-phase clinical trials, additional research that rigorously evaluates its impact on RPE-specific functions and long-term retinal health is warranted before it can be endorsed as a definitive therapeutic strategy (Falcão et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2022; Wong et al., 2013).
