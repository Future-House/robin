Proposal for Nicotinamide riboside (catalog N2004, Sigma-Aldrich)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Nicotinamide riboside (NR) is a naturally occurring pyridine-nucleoside and a member of the vitamin B3 family. It is chemically distinguished as a precursor to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD⁺), a vital coenzyme found in every cell that plays a central role in redox reactions, energy metabolism, and signaling pathways related to cellular stress and survival. NR was initially discovered as a component of milk and other food sources and has since been isolated, purified, and synthesized for research and nutraceutical purposes. The molecule is synthesized through chemical and biotechnological methods and is available commercially (catalog N2004, Sigma-Aldrich). It belongs to the class of NAD⁺ precursors, a group of compounds that have been historically used to boost intracellular NAD⁺ levels and thus enhance metabolic function. In the past, other members of this group, such as nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and nicotinamide itself, have been studied for their beneficial metabolic effects in aging and neurodegenerative disorders. As a nicotinamide riboside, this compound is of particular interest due to its oral bioavailability, favorable pharmacokinetics, and excellent safety profile in human supplementation (Jadeja et al., 2020; Lin & Apte, 2018).

Therapeutic History:
Nicotinamide riboside and related NAD⁺ precursors have been extensively investigated in both preclinical and early clinical studies targeting metabolic dysfunction, neurodegeneration, and age-related diseases. Although the majority of the research has focused on its role in systemic aging and neuroprotection in diseases such as glaucoma and mitochondrial myopathies, several preclinical studies demonstrate its potential application in ocular conditions. For example, clinical trial searches using terms such as “nicotinamide riboside AND (macular degeneration OR AMD OR retina OR RPE OR retinal degeneration)” have identified trials that investigate NAD⁺ precursors in retinal health contexts – even though direct evidence for dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is still emerging (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Furthermore, animal model studies report that NR supplementation can elevate NAD⁺ levels in the retina, leading to enhanced mitochondrial function and increased sirtuin activity, which are crucial for maintaining retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cell health (Jadeja et al., 2020; Lin & Apte, 2018). Additionally, related clinical trials, such as NCT06587945 and NCT06991712, have evaluated the tolerability and potential efficacy of NAD⁺ precursors in retinal diseases like macula-off retinal detachment and primary open-angle glaucoma. Though these trials do not directly target dry AMD, they provide supportive background evidence regarding the safety and biological effects of these agents in ocular tissues (Center for Eye Research Australia, 2024; Leung, 2025). Thus, while NR has a robust therapeutic history as an NAD⁺ booster in various models of aging and neurodegeneration, its repurposing for dry AMD is a logical extension based on its underlying biochemical roles in cellular metabolism and mitochondrial health.

Mechanism of Action:
The therapeutic rationale for employing nicotinamide riboside in dry AMD is anchored in its well-documented mechanism of action at the molecular level. NR serves as a biosynthetic precursor that is phosphorylated by nicotinamide riboside kinases (NRK1 and NRK2) to form nicotinamide mononucleotide, which is subsequently adenylated to NAD⁺ by NMNAT enzymes. Elevated NAD⁺ levels are crucial; NAD⁺ acts not only as a redox cofactor but also as a substrate for sirtuins—NAD⁺-dependent deacetylases that regulate numerous cellular processes, including autophagy, mitochondrial biogenesis, and stress resistance (Lin & Apte, 2018; Jadeja et al., 2020).

Sirtuins, particularly SIRT1 and SIRT3, are of paramount importance in retinal cells. SIRT1 activation promotes deacetylation of transcription factors, including PGC-1α, which in turn drives mitochondrial biogenesis and improves oxidative phosphorylation. By activating sirtuin-dependent pathways, NR thereby enhances autophagy—a catabolic process responsible for the clearance of damaged proteins and organelles. This process extends to sirtuin-dependent autophagy pathways in the retinal pigment epithelium, where autophagy is essential for the proper degradation of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) that RPE cells phagocytose on a regular basis (Lin & Apte, 2018; Jadeja et al., 2020).

Moreover, the activation of sirtuins by increased NAD⁺ may lead to enhanced mitophagy—the selective autophagy of damaged mitochondria—which is critically important for the maintenance of mitochondrial quality control in cells with high metabolic demand such as photoreceptors and RPE cells (Lin & Apte, 2018). Preclinical data also hint at improvements in the clearance of damaged cellular components and a reduction in oxidative stress markers, suggesting that NR may indirectly promote healthier RPE function by maintaining mitochondrial integrity (Jadeja et al., 2020; Ren et al., 2022).

At the molecular level, NAD⁺ and sirtuins regulate key signaling pathways such as the AMPK/mTOR axis. AMPK activation, a hallmark of energy stress, is associated with induction of autophagy, whereas mTOR inhibition similarly promotes autophagic processes. As such, by elevating NAD⁺ levels, NR can shift cellular metabolism toward increased mitochondrial turnover and improved bioenergetics, both of which are compromised in the RPE of patients with dry AMD. In addition, maintaining NAD⁺ levels prevents the activation of deleterious NAD⁺-consuming enzymes like PARP-1 which, when overactivated, lead to decreased NAD⁺ and energy failure (Lin & Apte, 2018; Jadeja et al., 2020). The overall cascade—from NR supplementation to NAD⁺ elevation, sirtuin activation, enhanced autophagy, and improved mitochondrial function—thereby establishes a clear molecular rationale for its potential use in drug repurposing for dry AMD.

Expected Effect:
Based on its mechanism of action, nicotinamide riboside is expected to exert several beneficial effects in the context of dry AMD, particularly in RPE cells. First, NR is anticipated to elevate intracellular NAD⁺ levels in RPE cells, thereby activating sirtuin enzymes such as SIRT1. Activation of SIRT1 is linked to improved mitochondrial health through the induction of mitochondrial biogenesis and the promotion of autophagy, a process critical for the removal of damaged cellular components. In the RPE, effective autophagy is essential not only for maintaining cellular homeostasis but also for the phagocytic clearance of photoreceptor outer segments—a process that deteriorates with age and contributes to the pathogenesis of dry AMD (Lin & Apte, 2018; Jadeja et al., 2020).

Enhancing mitochondrial function via increased NAD⁺ content is also expected to reduce oxidative stress, a major driver of cellular senescence in the RPE. Preclinical models have demonstrated that NAD⁺ precursors can ameliorate markers of senescence and inflammation in RPE cells by restoring mitochondrial membrane potential, increasing ATP production, and reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation (Ren et al., 2022; Jadeja et al., 2020). Furthermore, improved mitochondrial bioenergetics and the upregulation of transcription factors such as PGC-1α would likely contribute to a more robust antioxidant response through the regulation of NRF2 and other associated genes (Tong et al., 2022).

Additionally, increased sirtuin activity has been correlated with the regulation of several proteins involved in phagocytic processes in RPE cells. For instance, enhancing NAD⁺ levels has been shown to support the activity of proteins responsible for autophagy and lysosomal degradation, thereby potentially improving the phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments by RPE cells. This function is critical to prevent the build-up of cellular debris and toxic aggregates that can contribute to drusen formation and geographic atrophy in dry AMD (Lin & Apte, 2018; Wan et al., 2021).

Given the oral dosing of NR − which has demonstrated good bioavailability in human subjects – it is expected that systemic supplementation would translate into elevated NAD⁺ levels in ocular tissues as well. Although specific clinical evidence for dry AMD is not yet available, continued research and clinical trials in related retinal diseases (Center for Eye Research Australia, 2024; Leung, 2025) provide a foundation for expecting similar beneficial effects in dry AMD. In summary, the expected biological outcome of NR in the proposed assay is enhanced RPE viability through improved mitochondrial function, increased sirtuin-dependent autophagy, and restored phagocytic clearance of photoreceptor outer segments, which together would help slow or halt the progression of dry AMD (Lin & Apte, 2018; Jadeja et al., 2020).

Overall Evaluation:
Nicotinamide riboside emerges as a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for the treatment of dry age-related macular degeneration based on several compelling lines of evidence. Its strengths lie in its well-established ability to elevate NAD⁺ levels across multiple tissues, its excellent oral bioavailability, and its associated safety profile demonstrated in human studies. The mechanistic underpinnings—centered on NAD⁺ augmentation, sirtuin activation, and subsequent improvements in mitochondrial health and autophagy—are robustly supported by preclinical studies in retinal models and by growing clinical research in related ocular diseases (Lin & Apte, 2018; Jadeja et al., 2020).

Specifically, the reactivation of sirtuin pathways via NR supplementation is expected to enhance the autophagic clearance of photoreceptor outer segments by RPE cells, a process that is compromised in dry AMD. Improved mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis should alleviate energy deficits and reduce oxidative stress in RPE cells, thereby preserving their functionality and reducing cellular senescence. This complementary modulation of both energy metabolism and cellular quality control mechanisms is critical for a multifactorial disease such as dry AMD, which lacks effective treatment options (Jadeja et al., 2020; Lin & Apte, 2018).

Despite these strengths, some challenges and potential weaknesses remain. Direct clinical trial data supporting the efficacy of NR specifically in dry AMD patients are currently lacking. The majority of evidence stems from preclinical studies, animal models, or studies in related retinal conditions such as macula-off retinal detachment and glaucoma (Center for Eye Research Australia, 2024; Leung, 2025). While these data provide a strong scientific rationale, translational gaps must be addressed through targeted clinical trials that evaluate NR’s effect on RPE function, phagocytosis, and visual outcomes in patients with dry AMD. Additionally, while the overall safety profile of NR is favorable, long-term studies in an aging population with concurrent ocular pathology are necessary to confirm its safety and efficacy in the context of chronic administration.

Another area of potential weakness is the variability of NAD⁺ metabolism in human subjects, particularly in the advanced age groups most affected by dry AMD. Age-related declines in enzymes such as NAMPT, which are crucial for NAD⁺ salvage pathways, may affect the pharmacodynamics of NR supplementation. Research indicates that while NAD⁺ depletion is a hallmark of cellular aging, the degree of response to NAD⁺ precursors can be heterogeneous, and the therapeutic window may differ between individuals (Jadeja et al., 2018; Lin & Apte, 2018). Thus, patient stratification and biomarker studies will be essential in future clinical trials to identify those most likely to benefit from NR therapy.

Furthermore, the precise molecular mechanisms by which NR might improve RPE phagocytic function remain to be fully elucidated. Although the activation of sirtuin-dependent autophagy is a plausible explanation, additional studies are needed to clarify whether these pathways are sufficient to restore phagocytosis to pre-disease levels, or whether adjunctive therapies might be necessary. It is also important to consider that the regulation of autophagic flux in highly differentiated cells like RPE is complex and may be influenced by other factors that are not directly modulated by NR supplementation (Lin & Apte, 2018; Wan et al., 2021).

In summary, nicotinamide riboside holds significant promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry AMD. Its ability to boost NAD⁺ levels, activate sirtuin pathways, and enhance mitochondrial function forms a strong scientific basis for expecting improvements in RPE cell health and phagocytic function, which are central to mitigating dry AMD pathology. The accumulated evidence from related preclinical studies and early-phase clinical trials in ocular diseases supports further exploration of NR in dry AMD. However, it is imperative that future clinical studies are designed to directly assess the efficacy of NR in this patient population, with particular emphasis on achieving the desired modulation of cellular autophagy, mitochondrial dynamics, and RPE phagocytosis.

Overall, the strengths of NR include its established role as a safe and bioavailable NAD⁺ precursor, its robust mechanism of action involving sirtuin activation and mitochondrial protection, and supportive preclinical data in retinal models. The weaknesses center on the current lack of direct clinical evidence in dry AMD, potential variability in patient responses due to age-related metabolic changes, and the need for deeper insight into its effect on RPE phagocytic function. Taken together, nicotinamide riboside appears to be a promising candidate worthy of further investigation in the context of dry age-related macular degeneration, and its continued development could address a critical unmet need in this debilitating condition (Lin & Apte, 2018; Jadeja et al., 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).
