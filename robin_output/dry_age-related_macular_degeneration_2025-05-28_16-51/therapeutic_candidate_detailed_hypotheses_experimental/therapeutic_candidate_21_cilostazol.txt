Proposal for Cilostazol (Pletal®, catalog C1910, Sigma-Aldrich)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Cilostazol is a synthetic small‐molecule agent originally discovered and developed as a selective phosphodiesterase‐3 (PDE3) inhibitor that elevates intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels by blocking its degradation, thereby modulating diverse signaling pathways in vascular and neural tissues (Morishita, 2005). It belongs to the PDE inhibitor class, a chemically defined group of compounds that have historically been used in cardiovascular therapeutics for their antiplatelet, vasodilatory, and anti‐inflammatory actions, with cilostazol being marketed under the name Pletal® and approved for treating intermittent claudication and certain stroke prevention indications (Tanano et al., 2013). The compound is synthesized through chemical modification of the pyrimido-pyrimidine core structure and has been optimized to yield high selectivity for PDE3 isoforms, particularly those expressed in platelets and vascular smooth muscle cells (Asal & Wojciak, 2017). Owing to its ability to cross tissue barriers and its well‐characterized pharmacokinetic profile from extensive clinical use in peripheral vascular disorders, cilostazol has been proposed for repurposing in ocular diseases, especially dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD), where targeting the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a promising strategy (Yanai & Endo, 2019).

Therapeutic History:
Clinically, cilostazol has a robust history as a cardiovascular therapeutic agent and has been widely used to manage conditions such as intermittent claudication and to provide secondary stroke prevention given its antiplatelet and vasodilatory properties (Morishita, 2005; Trawally, 2023). Its beneficial effects on microcirculation have been documented in diverse vascular beds, including retinal and cerebral vessels, with experimental studies showing prolongation of endothelial barrier integrity and enhanced nitric oxide production, particularly in retinal arterioles (Tanano et al., 2013). Although cilostazol’s clinical use has been predominantly in cardiovascular indications and more recently in some studies addressing diabetic microvascular complications, there is no current clinical trial evidence using cilostazol specifically for dry AMD, as evidenced by a lack of entries in clinical trial databases (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). However, related preclinical research in retinal models, including studies on diabetic animal models, supports its anti‐oxidative and anti‐inflammatory effects in the retina (Yeh et al., 2019), and its documented neuroprotective actions in retinal ischemia models further suggest that its application might extend to conditions like dry AMD where RPE dysfunction and photoreceptor debris accumulation are central (Ishizuka et al., 2013).

Mechanism of Action:
Cilostazol exerts its primary pharmacological action by selectively inhibiting PDE3, which is responsible for the hydrolysis of cAMP in numerous cell types; this enzyme inhibition leads to an elevation in intracellular cAMP levels and subsequent activation of protein kinase A (PKA) (Morishita, 2005). In vascular cells, the increased cAMP activates PKA, which phosphorylates various targets including endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and reconfigures cytoskeletal and tight junction proteins to enhance endothelial barrier function—a mechanism that has been observed in brain microvascular endothelial cells (Liu et al., 2012). In the context of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), the hypothesis is that elevated cAMP through PDE3 inhibition can promote cytoskeletal rearrangements, which are crucial for the process of phagosome maturation and thus for the clearance of photoreceptor outer segment debris (Luu, 2024). Furthermore, cilostazol’s anti‐inflammatory actions are mediated by PKA‐dependent inhibition of key pro‐inflammatory transcription factors such as nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), which reduces the expression of adhesion molecules and inflammatory cytokines in vascular and possibly retinal cells (Coenen et al., 2021). The compound’s ability to modulate microcirculation by promoting vasodilation via nitric oxide production also contributes to improved retinal blood flow and potentially augments RPE cell function under stress conditions—a benefit supported by preclinical findings in retinal ischemia models (Ishizuka et al., 2013; Tanano et al., 2013).

Expected Effect:
The proposed mechanism underlying the therapeutic use of cilostazol in dry AMD is that its PDE3 inhibition will increase intracellular cAMP in RPE cells, leading not only to activation of PKA but also to a cascade of downstream effects that facilitate cytoskeletal reorganization and phagosome maturation. This, in turn, is expected to enhance the RPE’s capacity for phagocytosis—essential for clearing spent photoreceptor outer segment debris—thereby mitigating a key feature of dry AMD pathogenesis (Luu et al., 2023). In addition, the anti-inflammatory and vasodilatory effects of cilostazol are anticipated to reduce chronic low-grade inflammation and improve retinal microcirculation, which are both critical in preventing or slowing the progression of RPE dysfunction and subsequent photoreceptor degeneration common in dry AMD (Trawally, 2023; Yeh et al., 2019). Given that RPE cells express components of the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway, and that phagocytosis in these cells has been linked to proper cytoskeletal function and inflammatory regulation, cilostazol’s targeted action should theoretically enhance RPE survival and functionality (Luu, 2024). This dual mode of action—boosting debris clearance and stabilizing microvascular and inflammatory homeostasis—represents a compelling rationale for its application in dry AMD, even though direct clinical trial confirmation in this indication is currently lacking (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Overall Evaluation:
In summary, the repurposing of cilostazol for dry AMD is supported by an extensive body of preclinical research that highlights its multifaceted pharmacological profile, particularly its selective inhibition of PDE3 which leads to elevated cAMP levels and activation of PKA pathways. This mechanism not only underpins its established uses in improving vascular tone and reducing platelet aggregation but also offers a targeted approach to enhance RPE phagocytic function and reduce retinal inflammation—a combination of effects that are highly desirable in the treatment of dry AMD (Morishita, 2005; Ishizuka et al., 2013). Strengths of this therapeutic candidate include its known safety profile and pharmacokinetics from extensive clinical experience in cardiovascular indications, the mechanistic specificity offered by PDE3 inhibition compared to broader PDE inhibitors, and preclinical evidence of beneficial vascular and neuroprotective effects in retinal models (Tanano et al., 2013; Trawally, 2023). Furthermore, cilostazol’s ability to modulate key signaling pathways implicated in RPE function—such as through cytoskeletal rearrangement and phagosome maturation—aligns strongly with current understanding of the pathophysiology of dry AMD (Luu, 2024; Luu et al., 2023). However, weaknesses of the candidate include the complete absence of dedicated clinical trial data in the setting of dry AMD, potential challenges in achieving effective ocular drug delivery (especially if an oral formulation may not concentrate adequately in the retina), and the need for further targeted preclinical studies to specifically assess its effects on RPE phagocytic capacity and photoreceptor debris clearance in AMD-relevant models (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Yeh et al., 2019). Additionally, while broad anti‐inflammatory and vasodilatory benefits are suggested by the literature, precise correlates of these effects in the context of the intricate retinal microenvironment remain to be defined (Coenen et al., 2021; Luu, 2024).

Overall, cilostazol represents a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry AMD based on its mechanistic properties and established clinical history in other vascular-related indications. Its capacity to enhance cAMP-dependent signaling in RPE cells, coupled with its anti-inflammatory and microcirculatory benefits, provides a strong scientific rationale that merits further investigation through targeted preclinical studies and eventual early-phase clinical trials. The proposal to assess its effect on RPE phagocytosis and debris clearance is well-founded in the current literature describing PDE regulation in retinal cells, although careful attention must be given to the challenges of ocular drug delivery and subset-specific efficacy in the complex milieu of dry AMD (Luu, 2024; Trawally, 2023). In conclusion, while there are some uncertainties that require addressing through rigorous experimental validation, the overall therapeutic profile of cilostazol justifies its further development as a candidate for the treatment of dry AMD, and this line of investigation should be pursued to determine its translational viability in the ocular setting (Yanai & Endo, 2019; Ishizuka et al., 2013).
