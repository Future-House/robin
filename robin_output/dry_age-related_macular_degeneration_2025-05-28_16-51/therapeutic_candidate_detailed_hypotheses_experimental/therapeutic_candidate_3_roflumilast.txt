Proposal for Roflumilast (Daliresp®, catalog R6520, Sigma-Aldrich)

Below is the comprehensive evaluation of the proposal regarding repurposing Roflumilast (Daliresp®, catalog R6520, Sigma-Aldrich) for use in dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

• Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Roflumilast is a selective phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitor that was originally developed and approved for the treatment of inflammatory respiratory conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Its synthesis and development reflect standard synthetic medicinal chemistry techniques aimed at producing small molecules capable of modulation of cyclic nucleotide metabolism; in this case, by selectively inhibiting the PDE4 isoform, which hydrolyzes cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in various cell types. It belongs to a class of therapeutics with known anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. Drugs in this class have primarily been used in systemic inflammatory conditions—especially in the respiratory system—and, more recently, repurposing strategies are being investigated for applications in other tissues affected by chronic inflammation and degeneration. In our context, the interest in Roflumilast is driven by the possibility that, because PDE4 is expressed in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and other retinal cells, selective PDE4 inhibition can elevate intracellular cAMP, thereby triggering protein kinase A (PKA)‐mediated phosphorylation cascades that could modulate actin dynamics and cytoskeletal regulators essential for phagocytosis. This proposed mechanism is aligned with the idea of improving clearance of photoreceptor debris—which is a hallmark of dry AMD—through increased RPE phagocytic capacity. The extensive preclinical work using related agents such as rolipram (another PDE4 inhibitor) has been instrumental in establishing a safety and mechanistic profile that supports Roflumilast’s development for non-respiratory indications (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Luu, 2024).

• Therapeutic History:
Roflumilast is well-established clinically as an anti-inflammatory agent in respiratory disease, where its ability to suppress inflammatory cytokine production and immune cell activation has been confirmed in multiple Phase I–III clinical trials. In addition to its approved respiratory indications, other PDE4 inhibitors such as rolipram have been studied in a variety of contexts—including depressive disorders—and have demonstrated acceptable safety profiles at doses that elevate cAMP while mitigating inflammatory responses (Harding, 2024; Luu, 2024). However, despite extensive clinical use in non-ocular settings, a focused search of registered clinical trials addressing its use in macular degeneration, retinal diseases, or RPE-based pathologies has yielded no direct studies (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Consequently, while PDE4 inhibitors have been investigated across several disease models, there is a noted absence of clinical evidence specifically addressing their safety and efficacy in ocular diseases such as dry AMD. Preclinical studies using related compounds in animal models of retinal stress and degeneration have provided proof-of-concept that modulating the cAMP/PKA pathway via PDE4 inhibition can preserve retinal structure and function (Luu, 2024).

• Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, Roflumilast and its class members act by selectively inhibiting PDE4, an enzyme responsible for hydrolyzing intracellular cAMP. The inhibition of PDE4 results in elevated cAMP levels, which in turn activates PKA. The activation of PKA phosphorylates downstream substrates, including cytoskeletal regulators and other proteins involved in phagocytosis. In particular, RPE cells require dynamic actin remodeling to efficiently engulf and clear photoreceptor outer segment debris. The increased PKA activity may lead to phosphorylation of key targets such as cofilin and other actin-binding proteins, thereby enhancing phagocytic machinery activity. Moreover, several preclinical studies indicate that PDE4 inhibition leads to reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and apoptotic markers (e.g., TNFR1 and Fas), while simultaneously upregulating genes involved in cellular homeostasis and somatic maintenance (e.g., Glul, RdCVF) (Luu, 2024). Importantly, single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic analyses in murine models reveal that alterations in cyclic nucleotide signaling are associated with improved RPE function and retinal preservation, indirectly supporting a role for enhanced phagocytosis and clearance of photoreceptor debris (Luu, 2024). In macrophage models, for instance, increased cAMP levels have been shown to promote efferocytosis, and given the similar cellular machinery in RPE cells, it is reasonable to hypothesize that a comparable mechanism will be active here (Harding, 2024).

• Expected Effect:
The proposed hypothesis is that Roflumilast will act on RPE cells by increasing intracellular cAMP, leading to the activation of PKA‐mediated phosphorylation events that enhance actin remodeling. These events are essential for the phagocytosis and efficient clearance of photoreceptor debris—a process that is typically impaired in dry AMD. Based on the preclinical data from systems pharmacology investigations, selective PDE4 inhibition has been associated with the upregulation of homeostatic and neuroprotective pathways while suppressing stress-induced inflammatory cascades. In dry AMD, the accumulation of extracellular debris (drusen) and insufficient clearance by RPE cells contribute to disease progression through chronic inflammation and photoreceptor loss. Thus, by restoring RPE phagocytosis and enhancing cytoskeletal dynamics, Roflumilast is expected to reduce debris accumulation, improve retinal cell viability and structural integrity, and ultimately slow disease progression (Luu, 2024). In addition, the oral bioavailability and well-characterized pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile of Roflumilast, already established through its approved use in COPD, provide confidence in its translational feasibility to ocular contexts, even though direct ocular formulations (e.g., sustained-release intravitreal injections) may need to be explored to optimize local safety and efficacy (Luu, 2024).

• Overall Evaluation:
Overall, repurposing Roflumilast for dry AMD presents a compelling therapeutic opportunity based on sound mechanistic rationale, extensive safety data in other indications, and a convergence of evidence from systems pharmacology approaches that support PDE4 inhibition as a stress resilience-enhancing strategy. One of the principal strengths of this candidate is its well-characterized mechanism: the selective inhibition of PDE4 leading to increased intracellular cAMP and subsequent activation of PKA, which is critical for actin remodeling and successful phagocytosis by RPE cells. This mechanism is supported by multiple layers of evidence—from biochemical assays demonstrating changes in cAMP/PKA signaling to preclinical models that show improved retinal structure and function following PDE inhibition (Luu, 2024). Additionally, the long clinical history and established pharmacokinetic profile of Roflumilast in respiratory disease add a significant degree of translational feasibility and safety assurance, which are key for repurposed drugs in new indications (Harding, 2024; Luu, 2024).

On the other hand, a primary weakness is the current lack of direct clinical or preclinical data specifically demonstrating ocular efficacy. Although the mechanism is highly plausible and there is supportive evidence from analogous studies using rolipram as a representative PDE4 inhibitor, Roflumilast itself has not been evaluated directly in models of dry AMD or in studies assessing RPE phagocytosis of photoreceptor debris (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Luu, 2024). This gap necessitates further dedicated studies, including detailed in vitro assays in RPE cell lines and in vivo evaluations in appropriate animal models, to confirm not only that Roflumilast can modulate the cAMP/PKA pathway in ocular tissues but also that such modulation translates into meaningful structural and functional improvements in the retina.

Another consideration is the potential for systemic side effects given the oral administration of Roflumilast. While the safety profile in COPD patients is well established, ocular tissues have unique pharmacodynamic properties, and long-term systemic exposure might not fully capture the nuances of local retinal effects. Therefore, exploration of alternative delivery routes that maximize ocular tissue concentrations while minimizing systemic exposure—such as a sustained-release intravitreal formulation—may be necessary to safely and effectively repurpose this drug for dry AMD (Luu, 2024).

In conclusion, the mechanistic specificity provided by targeting PDE4 is highly attractive given its known role in regulating cAMP levels and promoting anti-inflammatory, cytoprotective, and phagocytic responses in cells. Roflumilast offers several advantages thanks to its established clinical history, well-understood pharmacology, and the converging preclinical evidence suggesting that enhancing RPE cell function via cAMP elevation could remediate key pathological features of dry AMD. Nevertheless, before a clinical development plan can be advanced, it is critical to generate robust preclinical data in ocular models to address the current knowledge gap regarding its effects on RPE phagocytosis, photoreceptor debris clearance, and overall retinal homeostasis.

Thus, from our comprehensive literature review drawing on biochemical, clinical, and cellular studies—and supported by numerous insights from systems pharmacology investigations—it is our evaluation that Roflumilast holds promising potential as a repurposed drug candidate for dry AMD. The next steps should focus on rigorous preclinical validation in retinal models and exploration of optimized ocular delivery strategies to fully determine its therapeutic efficacy for this indication (Luu, 2024; Cruz et al., 2020).
