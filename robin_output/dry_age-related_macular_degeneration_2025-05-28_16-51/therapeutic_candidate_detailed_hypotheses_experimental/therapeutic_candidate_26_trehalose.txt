Proposal for Trehalose (catalog T9531, Sigma-Aldrich)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Trehalose is a naturally occurring, nonreducing disaccharide composed of two glucose molecules linked via an α-1,1 glycosidic bond. Originally discovered in various organisms such as plants, fungi, insects, and bacteria, trehalose has evolved as a stress–protective molecule that enhances cell survival under conditions of dehydration, thermal stress, and oxidative challenge. In our context, trehalose (catalog T9531, Sigma-Aldrich) is considered a repurposed therapeutic candidate, which belongs to the class of naturally derived small molecules with osmoprotectant and protein–stabilizing properties. This class of compounds has traditionally been used to preserve the structure of proteins and cell membranes in various biotechnological applications and as excipients in formulation science (Stolz et al., 2011; Cejkova & Kubinova, 2019). Trehalose has attracted attention because its biochemical properties—such as water replacement and protection against denaturation—make it ideally suited for stabilizing labile protein structures and cellular organelles. In the case of dry age–related macular degeneration (AMD), trehalose is hypothesized to act as an autophagy inducer that not only stabilizes protein aggregates in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells but also enhances the degradation capacity of these cells by facilitating TFEB-mediated lysosomal biogenesis and improving phagosome–lysosome fusion (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Abokyi et al., 2020).

Therapeutic History:
Trehalose has been used extensively in preclinical models across various fields due to its autophagy–inducing and protein–stabilizing capabilities. Biochemically, trehalose has been shown to stimulate autophagy in neuronal cells and RPE models, modulating the expression of key autophagy markers such as LC3 (microtubule–associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3) and p62/SQSTM1. Specifically, studies in human RPE cells have provided evidence for trehalose’s ability to upregulate transcription factor EB (TFEB) and downstream autophagy-related genes (Abokyi et al., 2020). In addition, preclinical models of retinal neurodegeneration have demonstrated that trehalose can reduce oxidative stress, lower protein carbonylation, and improve cellular viability under conditions of stress induced by agents such as hydroquinone—a well–established oxidant linked to dry AMD pathology (Abokyi et al., 2021). Furthermore, its application in ophthalmology extends beyond retinal diseases, as trehalose has been used topically in dry eye models, where it has been shown to protect ocular surface epithelia from desiccation and oxidative damage (Stolz et al., 2011; Cejkova & Kubinova, 2019). Although direct clinical trial evidence in human dry AMD remains limited—as many clinical trial searches reveal only a large pool of related investigations rather than focused outcomes—preclinical data in both retinal degeneration and neurodegenerative disease models strongly support further evaluation of trehalose for dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Vessey et al., 2022).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, trehalose acts primarily as an autophagy inducer that bypasses the classical mTOR–dependent mechanisms. Instead, it stimulates autophagy by eliciting mild lysosomal stress, which in turn promotes the activation of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy. TFEB, when activated, translocates to the nucleus where it upregulates genes involved in the formation of autophagosomes, lysosomal enzymes (e.g., cathepsin D), and lysosomal membrane proteins (e.g., LAMP2) (Abokyi et al., 2020; Abokyi et al., 2021). This induction of TFEB is crucial because it enhances the lysosomal clearance capacity, enabling RPE cells to degrade damaged or aggregated proteins—including lipofuscin and accumulated photoreceptor outer segments—and recycle damaged organelles under conditions of chronic oxidative stress associated with dry AMD (Kaarniranta et al., 2023).

In biochemical assays, trehalose has been shown to increase autophagic flux as evidenced by elevated levels of LC3-II and a concomitant modulation of p62 levels—a marker that is indicative of either enhanced autophagosome formation or active turnover via autolysosomal degradation. Additionally, trehalose may facilitate the clearance of toxic protein aggregates by promoting phagosome–lysosome fusion, a process essential for the degradation of photoreceptor outer segments in the RPE. This is a critical point in the pathology of dry AMD, where inefficient clearance leads to the accumulation of cytotoxic debris that exacerbates oxidative damage and inflammation (Abokyi et al., 2020; Abokyi et al., 2021).

Furthermore, trehalose’s role as a chemical chaperone enables it to stabilize protein conformations during stress conditions, thereby reducing misfolding and aggregation. This is linked with its capacity to act independently of the proteasome pathway, suggesting that its effects in clearing protein aggregates depend primarily on enhancing autophagic mechanisms coordinated by TFEB (Jeong et al., 2021). In retinal cells, particularly in the RPE, the expression of TFEB and autophagy–related genes is well documented, and trehalose’s influence on these pathways is consistent with enhanced clearance of photoreceptor debris—thus reducing drusen formation and improving overall cellular homeostasis (Abokyi et al., 2020; Vessey et al., 2022).

Expected Effect:
In the proposed assays, trehalose is expected to enhance autophagic flux in RPE cells, leading to an increased clearance of photoreceptor outer segments and a concomitant decrease in the accumulation of lipofuscin and other toxic protein aggregates. This outcome is anticipated to occur through the activation of TFEB, resulting in upregulation of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy–related genes. Enhanced autophagy is further expected to restore homeostasis in RPE cells by reducing oxidative stress and dampening inflammation—key pathological mechanisms in dry AMD (Abokyi et al., 2021).

At the molecular level, one would measure an increase in the ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I, accompanied by increased levels of lysosomal proteins such as LAMP2 and cathepsin D. Additionally, there should be evidence of nuclear translocation of TFEB, as this is a direct marker of its activation. Such changes have been quantified in previous in vitro studies in RPE models where trehalose treatment reduced protein carbonylation and oxidative stress markers (Abokyi et al., 2020; Abokyi et al., 2021). In animal models, such as those using APOE-deficient mice—which mimic certain aspects of dry AMD—the administration of trehalose has been associated with improved electroretinogram (ERG) responses without gross morphological changes in retinal layers, indicating preserved photoreceptor function due to enhanced proteostasis (Vessey et al., 2022).

In assays involving RPE cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), one would also expect stabilization of the phagocytic machinery. This entails enhancement of autophagosome formation and a boosted fusion with lysosomes, ultimately resulting in better clearance of photoreceptor outer segments. Moreover, given that RPE cells are postmitotic and particularly vulnerable to cumulative oxidative damage, improved autophagy could potentially delay or mitigate the progression of dry AMD (Abokyi et al., 2021).

Overall Evaluation:
Based on the comprehensive literature review and the preclinical evidence available, trehalose emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate for dry AMD. Its strengths lie in its natural origin, biocompatibility, and dual functionality as both an autophagy inducer and a protein–stabilizing agent. The evidence consistently shows that trehalose activates the TFEB pathway, thereby enhancing lysosomal biogenesis and autophagic flux (Jeong et al., 2021; Abokyi et al., 2020). This molecular mechanism directly addresses the pathological hallmarks of dry AMD, notably the accumulation of toxic protein aggregates and photoreceptor outer segment debris in RPE cells that lead to cell dysfunction and subsequent retinal degeneration. Its disaccharide structure ensures low toxicity and favorable ocular delivery properties, as evidenced by its use in ophthalmological applications such as dry eye treatment (Stolz et al., 2011; Cejkova & Kubinova, 2019).

However, there are also some weaknesses and challenges that need to be addressed. First, while the preclinical data are strong, clinical evidence specifically targeting dry AMD is still limited. Although several clinical trials have investigated trehalose in ocular conditions, the data in the context of retinal degeneration and RPE function are less robust. Moreover, the pharmacokinetics of trehalose, particularly its absorption and distribution in the retinal tissues upon various routes of administration, require further optimization, as oral delivery may not achieve therapeutically relevant concentrations in the retina (Jeong et al., 2021; Evans et al., 2018). Second, while activation of TFEB is desirable for enhancing autophagic clearance, uncontrolled or excessive autophagy may inadvertently lead to autophagic cell death if the pathway is overactivated. Thus, dosing regimens will have to be carefully optimized to ensure that autophagy is enhanced within a therapeutic window without tipping into cytotoxicity (Abokyi et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2020).

Furthermore, although the hypothesis emphasizes the stabilization of protein aggregates and the promotion of phagosome–lysosome fusion specifically in RPE cells, additional studies are required to dissect these processes in the complex environment of the retina. The interplay between trehalose-induced autophagy and other neuroprotective pathways—as well as its impact on inflammation—needs more in-depth characterization in both in vitro and in vivo models of dry AMD (Abokyi et al., 2020; Vessey et al., 2022).

In summary, trehalose holds significant promise as a repurposed drug candidate for dry AMD due to its ability to induce autophagy via TFEB activation, promote lysosomal biogenesis, and enhance the clearance of toxic intracellular aggregates. Its favorable biocompatibility profile and prior evidence from ophthalmological and neurodegenerative applications further support its potential. However, the limitations regarding its clinical pharmacokinetics and the necessity for precise dosing underscore the need for further translational research. Overall, trehalose is a viable candidate to pursue, and additional studies focusing on its delivery to retinal tissues, dosing optimization, and long-term efficacy in appropriate dry AMD models are warranted to validate and expand upon its therapeutic potential (Abokyi et al., 2021; Kaarniranta et al., 2023; Jeong et al., 2021).
