Proposal for Bardoxolone methyl (CDDO-Me, catalog S1498, Selleck Chemicals)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Bardoxolone methyl (also known as CDDO‐Me) is a synthetic oleanane triterpenoid derived from naturally occurring oleanolic acid, a plant-based compound with long-standing use in traditional medicine. Its synthesis involved chemical modifications of the oleanolic acid scaffold to enhance both its potency and bioavailability, resulting in a series of derivatives collectively classified as synthetic triterpenoids. This class of compounds has been developed to act as potent activators of the nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway, a major regulator of cellular detoxification and antioxidant defenses. Bardoxolone methyl, catalog S1498 from Selleck Chemicals, is a representative of these highly electrophilic agents that target cysteine residues on inhibitory proteins such as Keap1. The chemical modifications—often including the installation of cyano enone moieties—are designed to enable covalent binding to specific cysteines in Keap1, thereby preventing the usual ubiquitination and degradation of Nrf2. In essence, it couples the original natural product framework with modern medicinal chemistry techniques to create a molecule that has found applications primarily in conditions known to involve oxidative stress and inflammation (Camer et al., 2014; Sporn et al., 2011).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, Bardoxolone methyl has been developed and clinically evaluated for diseases characterized by chronic oxidative stress and inflammation. Notably, it has been studied in the context of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetic nephropathy, where clinical trials such as the BEAM and BEACON studies investigated its potential to improve renal function by modulating oxidative pathways. This extensive clinical experience in renal conditions provides important pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data that contribute to understanding its safety profile in human subjects. Although Bardoxolone methyl has not been directly approved for ocular indications, preclinical studies have demonstrated retinal protective effects in oxidative injury models, and its mechanism of action is highly relevant to the pathogenesis observed in dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD). The compound’s ability to induce Nrf2 and upregulate endogenous antioxidant enzymes has also been explored in other models of inflammation and oxidative stress, suggesting that it might be repurposed for diseases such as dry AMD where retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) oxidative damage is a major component of pathology (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Cheng et al., 2021).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, Bardoxolone methyl functions predominantly as an activator of the Nrf2 pathway. Under homeostatic conditions, Nrf2 is sequestered in the cytosol by Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), which facilitates its ubiquitin-dependent degradation, thereby maintaining low basal levels of antioxidant gene expression. Bardoxolone methyl disrupts this regulatory interaction through its electrophilic cyano enone moiety, which covalently modifies specific cysteine residues on Keap1, most notably Cys151. This modification prevents Keap1 from targeting Nrf2 for proteasomal degradation, allowing stabilized Nrf2 to accumulate, translocate into the nucleus, and dimerize with small Maf proteins. Once in the nucleus, the Nrf2 complex binds to antioxidant response elements (AREs) located in the promoters of various genes, leading to the robust transcription of phase II detoxification and antioxidant enzymes including NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and enzymes involved in glutathione synthesis such as glutamate-cysteine ligase. These events collectively result in enhanced cellular antioxidant capacity and cytoprotection against reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are central to the pathology of dry AMD. The activation of Nrf2 also indirectly influences autophagy pathways, potentially promoting lysosomal biogenesis and improved clearance of damaged proteins and organelles—a process critical for maintaining RPE homeostasis and efficient phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments (Naidu & Dinkova-Kostova, 2020; Nakagami et al., 2015; Nakagami, 2016).

Expected Effect:
In the context of dry AMD, the hypothesis is that Bardoxolone methyl, via its Nrf2-mediated mechanism, will upregulate antioxidant and autophagy genes in RPE cells. This upregulation is expected to reduce oxidative damage that is a hallmark of the disease and improve the efficiency of phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments, which is critical for retinal health. The anticipated biochemical effects include a decrease in the levels of ROS, an enhanced expression of cytoprotective enzymes, and an improvement in the autophagic flux within RPE cells. Because oxidative stress plays a fundamental role in the degeneration of the RPE and the subsequent loss of photoreceptor function in dry AMD, restoring redox homeostasis via Nrf2 activation is a promising therapeutic strategy. Additionally, increased lysosomal biogenesis, as a downstream effect of Nrf2 activation, could contribute to better phagosome clearance and improved recycling of photoreceptor outer segment material in RPE cells, thereby slowing disease progression. The expression of key Nrf2 target genes in RPE cells has been well-documented in preclinical studies, and some evidence suggests that pharmacologically induced Nrf2 activity protects these cells from oxidative injury (Cheng et al., 2021; Handa, 2012).

Overall Evaluation:
Bardoxolone methyl represents a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in the treatment of dry AMD due to several significant strengths. First, its well-characterized mechanism of action—a potent and specific activation of the Nrf2 pathway via disruption of Keap1–Nrf2 binding—is directly relevant to the oxidative stress observed in dry AMD. The compound’s ability to robustly upregulate antioxidant and detoxification genes provides a mechanistic rationale for its protective effects in the RPE. Second, the preclinical evidence that supports its retinal protective properties, combined with its potential to enhance autophagy and lysosomal function, aligns strongly with the cellular pathophysiology of dry AMD, where oxidative damage and inefficient phagocytic clearance are central contributors. Third, extensive clinical experience in chronic kidney disease, with detailed pharmacokinetic and safety profiles, offers a valuable starting point for repurposing efforts, providing key translational insights and reducing the early risk in drug development for an ocular indication (Mathis & Cui, 2016; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

However, there are also notable potential weaknesses and challenges that must be carefully addressed. Prior clinical trials in renal indications have revealed significant safety concerns, including adverse cardiovascular events, which underscore the narrow therapeutic window and potential systemic toxicities associated with potent Nrf2 activators (Vaziri et al., 2015; Tobalem & Uçkay, 2013). Therefore, while systemic administration of Bardoxolone methyl has been explored in kidney disease, its use for dry AMD might require localized ocular delivery strategies to minimize systemic exposure and side effects. Furthermore, there remains a paucity of direct clinical data for Bardoxolone methyl in retinal diseases despite encouraging preclinical findings, meaning that substantial preclinical and early clinical studies will be needed to specifically validate its safety and efficacy in the ocular setting. Another challenge is the possibility that chronic activation of Nrf2 could have off-target effects or result in a state of “reductive stress” if antioxidant responses are excessively induced, which may adversely impact cellular signaling pathways over time. Finally, while its oral formulation and previous human dosing data are strengths for translational considerations, the delivery mechanism suitable for retinal tissues might differ, necessitating novel formulation work.

In summary, Bardoxolone methyl’s profile as a potent Nrf2 activator with demonstrated systemic and preclinical antioxidant effects presents a strong scientific rationale for its repurposing in dry AMD. Its mechanism of disrupting Keap1–Nrf2 interactions to enhance endogenous antioxidative defenses and promote autophagy corresponds well to the known pathology of RPE degeneration in AMD. Nevertheless, the potential systemic side effects observed in earlier clinical trials, coupled with a lack of direct clinical evidence in ocular models, suggest that further preclinical studies and development of localized delivery systems will be critical to fully realize its therapeutic potential in the retinal context (Handa, 2012; Cheng et al., 2021). Overall, Bardoxolone methyl is a promising candidate that merits further investigation, provided that its dosing, delivery, and safety profiles can be optimized specifically for ocular application in dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Mathis & Cui, 2016).
