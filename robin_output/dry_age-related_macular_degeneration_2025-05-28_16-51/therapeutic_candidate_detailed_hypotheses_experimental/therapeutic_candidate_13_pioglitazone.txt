Proposal for Pioglitazone (Actos®, catalog PZ004, Sigma-Aldrich)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Pioglitazone (Actos®, catalog PZ004, Sigma-Aldrich) is a synthetic compound belonging to the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class, a family of PPARγ agonists originally discovered and developed to improve insulin sensitivity in patients with type 2 diabetes. The TZD drugs were designed based on structure–activity relationship studies aimed at modulating a nuclear transcription factor that regulates genes controlling lipid and glucose homeostasis. Pioglitazone, specifically, was synthesized through organic chemistry methods that introduce a thiazolidinedione moiety fused with an aromatic group to promote binding to the ligand-binding domain of PPARγ. This chemical class has a well-established history in metabolic modulation and anti-inflammatory applications. Their capability to bind to PPARγ alters gene transcription patterns in a variety of tissues. Beyond its antidiabetic effects, emerging research has demonstrated that PPARγ activation has pleiotropic effects in other tissues, including the retina, where modulating inflammation and cellular homeostasis are critical factors in disease progression (Zhang, Gu, & Hu, 2015, pp. 3–4).

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic utility of pioglitazone has been extensively evaluated in the context of type 2 diabetes, where its insulin-sensitizing properties, favorable oral pharmacokinetics, and an established safety profile in diabetic cohorts have made it a mainstay in chronic metabolic management. Clinically, pioglitazone has been used for decades to manage hyperglycemia and to mitigate the long-term vascular complications of diabetes. Beyond its metabolic use, a growing body of research has focused on its anti-inflammatory effects—specifically its ability to downregulate pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β—and on its capacity to improve oxidative stress resistance in various tissues. Preclinical studies in ocular models, including some in diabetic retinopathy and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cell models, have shown that pioglitazone can protect retinal cells from oxidative injury and, importantly, support cellular processes linked to phagocytosis and autophagosome–lysosome fusion. Although direct clinical trials in dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) are lacking, evidence from experimental models implies that a similar mechanism of RPE preservation might be achievable with pioglitazone. In diabetic retinopathy studies, pioglitazone has been associated with retinal microvascular improvements and neuroprotection—findings that are encouraging when considering its potential repurposing for dry AMD, a disease characterized by chronic inflammation, RPE dysfunction, and impaired clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Khatol, Saraf, & Jain, 2018, pp. 4–9).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, pioglitazone functions as an agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), a nuclear receptor that, upon ligand binding, heterodimerizes with the retinoid X receptor (RXR). This complex then binds to specific PPAR response elements (PPREs) in the promoter regions of target genes, thereby modulating their transcription. The genes regulated by PPARγ include those involved in lipid metabolism, cell differentiation, insulin sensitivity, and inflammatory responses. In retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, PPARγ is expressed and appears to be dynamically regulated during phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments—a process essential for photoreceptor renewal and retinal homeostasis. Activation of PPARγ by pioglitazone has been shown to suppress key pro-inflammatory mediators, reducing the activation of transcription factors such as NF-κB and AP-1, which in turn leads to decreased expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, and other cytokines implicated in chronic ocular inflammation. This anti-inflammatory mechanism is crucial, as inflammation is a key driver of RPE degeneration in dry AMD. Moreover, PPARγ agonism is associated with enhanced antioxidant responses, an effect partly mediated by increased glutathione (GSH) levels and activation of downstream kinases such as MAPK. There is emerging evidence suggesting that PPARγ activation may also promote autophagic flux by upregulating genes associated with lysosomal biogenesis and autophagosome formation, potentially leading to an improved fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. This enhanced autophagic clearance is particularly relevant in the context of dry AMD, where accumulation of photoreceptor outer segment debris due to impaired degradation contributes to RPE dysfunction and drusen formation. In summary, the molecular interactions of pioglitazone include:
– Binding to the ligand-binding pocket of PPARγ and promoting its heterodimerization with RXR.
– Transcriptional regulation of antioxidant defenses, inflammatory mediators, and lipid handling genes.
– Modulation of autophagy-related processes, which may result in improved autophagosome–lysosome fusion and clearance of toxic protein/lipid aggregates in the RPE (Zhang, Gu, & Hu, 2015, pp. 3–4; Choudhary & Malek, 2016, pp. 11–12; Di Rosa et al., 2016, pp. 15–16).

Expected Effect:
Based on the hypothesis and the known actions of pioglitazone, the expected effect in dry AMD would be multifactorial. First, by activating PPARγ, pioglitazone is anticipated to reduce the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the RPE and neighboring retinal tissues, thereby attenuating the chronic inflammatory milieu observed in dry AMD. The decrease in cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β would mitigate immune-mediated damage to the RPE, which is critical given that inflammation is a major contributor to the progression of RPE atrophy in dry AMD. Second, pioglitazone is expected to enhance autophagy by promoting autophagosome–lysosome fusion in RPE cells. This improved autophagic clearance could lead to more efficient degradation of photoreceptor outer segments, which accumulate as lipofuscin and other toxic deposits when clearance is compromised. The phagocytic function of RPE is essential for maintaining the health of photoreceptors, and dysfunction in this process is a hallmark of dry AMD pathology. Third, the drug’s capacity to upregulate antioxidant defenses should help protect RPE cells from oxidative stress, a well-known trigger for cellular degeneration in retinal diseases. Importantly, the expression of PPARγ in RPE cells has been demonstrated in several studies, and its selective upregulation during photoreceptor outer segment phagocytosis suggests that modulating this receptor could directly influence the degradative pathways needed for photoreceptor maintenance. Ultimately, the combined anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and autophagy-enhancing effects of pioglitazone are hypothesized to slow or even halt the progression of dry AMD by preserving RPE health and function, thereby maintaining photoreceptor integrity and visual function (Zhang, Gu, & Hu, 2015, pp. 6–7; Brooks et al., 2023, pp. 6–7; Khatol et al., 2018, pp. 28–30).

Overall Evaluation:
Pioglitazone presents as a promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of dry AMD based on several compelling factors. One of the major strengths of pioglitazone is its well-characterized safety profile. Having been in clinical use for the management of type 2 diabetes for many years, its pharmacokinetic properties and systemic tolerability are well documented. This existing clinical data provides an advantageous starting point for repurposing, potentially reducing development time and facilitating regulatory approval if efficacy in dry AMD can be demonstrated. Moreover, the molecular mechanism of pioglitazone—centered on PPARγ activation—addresses several key pathological processes implicated in dry AMD. The drug’s anti-inflammatory effects, demonstrated by its ability to downregulate pro-inflammatory cytokines and modulate NF-κB signaling, are directly relevant to mitigating the chronic retinal inflammation observed in dry AMD. Additionally, the potential of pioglitazone to promote autophagic clearance by enhancing autophagosome–lysosome fusion in RPE cells is a highly attractive feature given that defective clearance of photoreceptor outer segments is implicated in the accumulation of drusen and subsequent RPE dysfunction. Experimental data suggest that PPARγ expression in RPE cells is upregulated during phagocytosis, indicating that pharmacologic activation of this pathway could restore or enhance the degradative capability of these cells. Furthermore, its ability to enhance antioxidant defenses provides a dual protective effect against the oxidative stress that drives retinal degeneration. However, there are some potential weaknesses and challenges that must be considered. Despite its established safety in diabetic cohorts, pioglitazone is not without side effects; systemic administration of TZDs has been associated with fluid retention and, in some cases, an increased risk of macular edema, as noted in some observational studies of diabetic populations. These safety concerns underscore the need for careful dosing regimens and possibly targeted ocular delivery strategies to minimize systemic exposure while maximizing retinal drug levels. Additionally, while preclinical retinal models have shown encouraging results, direct clinical evidence supporting the efficacy of pioglitazone in dry AMD is lacking at present. The proposed mechanisms, though robust in theory and supported by studies in diabetic retinopathy and other ocular inflammatory models, require validation specifically in the context of dry AMD. Rigorous in vitro studies using RPE cell cultures and in vivo models of dry AMD will be necessary to establish the effectiveness of pioglitazone in improving autophagy, reducing inflammation, and preserving photoreceptor function. Finally, the multifactorial nature of dry AMD pathogenesis means that a single-agent approach might not be sufficient in all cases, and combination therapies may ultimately be needed to address the complex interplay of oxidative stress, inflammation, and autophagy deficits. In summary, pioglitazone’s established pharmacological profile, known receptor-mediated mechanisms, and experimental evidence in retinal cell models provide a strong rationale for its further investigation as a therapeutic agent for dry AMD. However, given the potential side effects and the current lack of direct clinical efficacy data in dry AMD, a careful and systematic preclinical and early-phase clinical evaluation is warranted before advancing into large-scale clinical trials (Choudhary & Malek, 2016, pp. 11–12; Khatol et al., 2018, pp. 22–24; Zhang, Gu, & Hu, 2015, pp. 7–8).

Overall, our comprehensive evaluation indicates that pioglitazone exhibits several desirable features as a candidate for repurposing in dry AMD treatment. Its capacity to modulate inflammatory gene expression, enhance antioxidant defenses, and potentially improve autophagosome–lysosome fusion in RPE cells aligns directly with our therapeutic hypothesis. The drug’s favorable oral pharmacokinetics and existing extensive clinical safety record in diabetic populations further strengthen its translational feasibility. Nonetheless, targeted studies focusing on retinal-specific outcomes—including assessments of RPE autophagy, photoreceptor outer segment clearance, and ocular fluid dynamics—are essential to confirm its efficacy and optimize dosage specifically for the treatment of dry AMD. These investigations should include both mechanistic in vitro assays using RPE models and in vivo animal studies that mimic the chronic degenerative processes of dry AMD, followed by carefully designed early-phase clinical trials. Given the multifactorial pathology of dry AMD, pioglitazone may be most effective as part of a combination approach that addresses other contributing mechanisms such as oxidative stress and abnormal lipid metabolism. In conclusion, while challenges remain, the current literature supports pioglitazone as a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry AMD that merits further detailed investigation in preclinical and clinical settings (Core et al., 2023, pp. 4–6; Di Rosa et al., 2016, pp. 15–16; Nadeem et al., 2022, pp. 14–15).
