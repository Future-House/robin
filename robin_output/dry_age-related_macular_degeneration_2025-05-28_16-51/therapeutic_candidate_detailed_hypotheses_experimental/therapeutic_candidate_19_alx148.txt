Proposal for ALX148 (Evorpacept, engineered SIRPα-Fc decoy)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
ALX148, also known as evorpacept, is an engineered, high‐affinity SIRPα-Fc decoy protein designed to disrupt the inhibitory interaction between CD47 and SIRPα. This therapeutic candidate is a recombinant fusion protein in which the extracellular domain of SIRPα, the natural ligand for CD47, is genetically fused to the constant region (Fc) of human immunoglobulin G1 that has been modified to have an inactive Fc domain, thereby minimizing unwanted effector functions (Logtenberg et al., 2020). ALX148 was originally discovered and developed in the context of oncology, where blocking the CD47 “don’t eat me” signal has been shown to enhance the phagocytosis of tumor cells by macrophages; its design focuses on high specificity for CD47 and reduced Fc receptor engagement, which reduces off-target toxicity such as excessive erythrocyte clearance (Logtenberg et al., 2020). As a biologic, ALX148 belongs to the class of immune checkpoint modulators, and this class of compounds has been widely studied for applications in cancer immunotherapy, where similar agents have demonstrated the ability to modulate phagocytic activity in the tumor microenvironment (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Its synthesis relies on recombinant DNA technology and protein expression systems, which not only ensure a consistent manufacturing process but also facilitate modifications that can tune its binding affinity and pharmacologic properties for clinical applications (Logtenberg et al., 2020).

Therapeutic History:
The primary development history of ALX148 is rooted in oncology, where it has been evaluated in several early phase clinical trials addressing advanced solid tumors and lymphomas (U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2017; U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2022a). In these trials, ALX148 was administered either as a monotherapy or in combination with a variety of immune-enhancing agents such as immune checkpoint inhibitors and chemotherapies to counteract the CD47-mediated “don’t eat me” signal prevalent in cancer cells (U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2017). The mechanism exploited by ALX148 has been validated in preclinical tumor models, where targeting CD47 enhanced macrophage-mediated phagocytosis and improved anti-tumor immune responses (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). While ALX148 has an established clinical profile in oncology – with extensive safety and pharmacokinetic data now available from multi-center studies – there has been no direct prior clinical or veterinary use of ALX148 for treating dry age-related macular degeneration. However, the CD47-SIRPα signaling axis is recognized as a key regulator of phagocytosis in various tissues, including the retina, and its modulation has been implicated in maintaining immune homeostasis in neural tissues (Chen et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2022). A recent clinical trial in oncology further underscores the clinical-grade manufacturability and tolerability of ALX148, yet its repurposing for ocular diseases remains investigational and is supported only by mechanistic similarities between tumor-associated macrophage models and the phagocytic regulation observed in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells (U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2022b).

Mechanism of Action:
The fundamental mechanism of action of ALX148 revolves around its capacity to sequester CD47 on target cells, thus preventing the inhibitory binding of CD47 to its receptor SIRPα on phagocytes such as macrophages and microglia. Normally, CD47, widely expressed on many cell types including RPE cells and photoreceptor debris, binds to SIRPα to deliver a “don’t eat me” signal that suppresses subsequent phagocytosis (Chen et al., 2019; Logtenberg et al., 2020). By competitively binding to CD47, ALX148 disrupts this inhibitory interaction, thereby lifting the blockade on phagocytosis. In the context of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), where the accumulation of debris due to insufficient clearance by the RPE is a key pathogenic factor, ALX148 is hypothesized to enhance the uptake and degradation of photoreceptor outer segments and other cellular debris (Chen et al., 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additionally, by blocking CD47, ALX148 may indirectly promote anti-inflammatory cytokine production (such as TGF-β synthesis) that is normally enhanced when the CD47-SIRPα pathway is active, which can foster a more favorable retinal microenvironment that supports cellular homeostasis (Chen et al., 2019). The engineered SIRPα-Fc decoy is designed to have a high binding affinity for CD47 while minimizing Fc-dependent effector functions, thereby offering a targeted approach that reduces the risk of adverse events related to nonspecific immune cell activation (Logtenberg et al., 2020). In summary, ALX148’s molecular action involves interrupting the intrinsic immune checkpoint that normally hampers phagocytosis, transforming the microenvironment to one that is more conducive to debris clearance and tissue regeneration, which is pivotal in maintaining retinal integrity in dry AMD (Jiang et al., 2022).

Expected Effect:
The anticipated effect of ALX148 in the setting of dry AMD centers on enhancing the clearance of accumulated photoreceptor outer segments and other cellular debris by the RPE. In normal physiology, RPE cells continuously phagocytose shed outer segments from photoreceptors; however, in dry AMD, dysregulation of this process contributes to debris accumulation and subsequent retinal degeneration (Chen et al., 2019). By sequestering CD47 and nullifying its interaction with SIRPα, ALX148 is expected to lift the inhibitory “don’t eat me” signal, thereby increasing the phagocytic capacity of both tissue-resident macrophages and RPE cells (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Preclinical models investigating immune checkpoint modulation in ocular contexts have demonstrated that manipulating the CD47/SIRPα axis can facilitate increased clearance of cellular debris without eliciting overt inflammation, thereby preserving retinal architecture and function (Wang et al., 2021; Jiang et al., 2022). Furthermore, enhanced efferocytosis triggered by such interventions is associated with a subsequent reduction in chronic low-grade inflammation, which is an important pathogenic component in dry AMD, as it impairs tissue repair and cell survival (Chen et al., 2019; Logtenberg et al., 2020). It is anticipated that in the proposed assays, ALX148 will promote measurable increases in the uptake and degradation of outer segment debris by RPE cells, and, by doing so, help restore the normal homeostatic balance in the subretinal space. Moreover, the expression of CD47 on these cell types is well documented, and modulation of its signaling has been previously shown to impact phagocytic efficacy in analogous systems such as tumor-associated macrophages (Chen et al., 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Ultimately, the desired effect is not merely increased phagocytosis, but controlled enhancement that avoids collateral damage to healthy cells while mitigating the accumulation of pro-inflammatory debris that underpins AMD progression (Logtenberg et al., 2020).

Overall Evaluation:
The repurposing of ALX148 for dry AMD holds significant promise based on its well-characterized mechanism of action and established clinical safety profile in oncology. One major strength of ALX148 is its high affinity and specificity for CD47, which provides a precise means to disrupt the CD47-SIRPα inhibitory axis without triggering excessive off-target immune activation (Logtenberg et al., 2020). This engineered biologic has already been subjected to rigorous clinical evaluation in cancer patients (U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2017; U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2022b), which supports its manufacturability and potential safety in a chronic dosing regimen. The underlying hypothesis that ALX148 can lift the “don’t eat me” signal in RPE cells and enhance the clearance of photoreceptor debris is well grounded in the existing literature on CD47-SIRPα-mediated regulation of phagocytosis in the retina and central nervous system (Chen et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2022). In preclinical models of retinal degeneration, modulation of phagocytosis has shown beneficial effects, and similar immune checkpoint interventions in oncology further attest to the feasibility of this strategy (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

However, several weaknesses and challenges must be acknowledged. While the mechanism in oncology is robust, the ocular environment, particularly the immune-privileged status of the retina, poses unique challenges regarding drug delivery, local immune modulation, and safety (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). There is currently insufficient direct preclinical data on ALX148 in ocular models or specific clinical trials targeting dry AMD, indicating the need for rigorous in vivo studies to assess retinal-specific efficacy and potential adverse effects such as unintended overactivation of microglia or excessive clearance that might inadvertently harm viable photoreceptors (Logtenberg et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2019). Additionally, while ALX148 minimizes Fc receptor activation by employing an engineered Fc domain, the long-term effects of CD47 blockade in the retina remain uncertain, especially in regard to balancing enhanced phagocytosis with the risk of disrupting neuroprotective signals provided by the CD47-SIRPα interaction (Logtenberg et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2019). An inherent challenge of repurposing an agent from oncology is that its dosing regimen, systemic exposure, and pharmacodynamics may differ when applied to a localized ocular pathology, and robust ocular delivery strategies must be devised to ensure localized treatment without systemic spillover. Moreover, while the concept of enhancing RPE-mediated clearance is appealing, the modulation of phagocytosis in a diseased retina must be finely tuned to avoid precipitating inflammatory cascades that can exacerbate degeneration (Wang et al., 2021; Jiang et al., 2022).

In conclusion, ALX148 represents a compelling candidate for repurposing in dry AMD due to its engineered specificity for CD47, well-established mechanism in releasing the inhibitory phagocytosis checkpoint, and supportive clinical safety data in oncology settings (U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2017; Logtenberg et al., 2020). Its potential to enhance RPE-mediated clearance of photoreceptor debris addresses a critical unmet need in the treatment of dry AMD. However, to fully validate its therapeutic utility, additional investigations are required to generate ocular-specific preclinical data, optimize local delivery methodologies, and carefully monitor for any deleterious effects resulting from altered phagocytic regulation in retinal tissues (Chen et al., 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Overall, the strengths of ALX148 in terms of targeted mechanism, engineered safety, and clinically proven manufacturability are substantial, yet the transition from systemic oncology applications to localized ocular therapy will necessitate a cautious and thorough development program aimed at addressing the unique challenges of the retinal environment.
