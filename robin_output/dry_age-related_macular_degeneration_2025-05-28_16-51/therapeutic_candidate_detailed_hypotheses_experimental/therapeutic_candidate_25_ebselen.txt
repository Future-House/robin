Proposal for Ebselen (catalog E1014, Sigma-Aldrich)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Ebselen is a synthetic organoselenium compound chemically defined as 2-phenyl-1,2-benzisoselenazol-3(2H)-one. Its discovery dates back nearly a century when early pioneers such as Lesser and Weiss first investigated selenium‐containing aromatic compounds, and its modern development evolved through refined synthetic routes. Early synthetic methods involve the use of anthranilic acid derivatives which, through diazotization followed by selenenylation with disodium diselenide, yield key intermediates that are then treated with chlorine sources (for example, thionyl chloride) to form a chloroseleno benzoyl chloride intermediate; subsequent acylation with an amine leads to the benzisoselenazolone core (Bhabak & Mugesh, 2007, pp. 1–2; Martins & Mendes, 2020, pp. 295–297). Alternative synthetic approaches include one-pot procedures that involve ortho-lithiation of benzanilides to create dianion intermediates, insertion of elemental selenium, and finally oxidative cyclization in the presence of copper catalysts – a method which has contributed to increased overall yield and efficiency (Martins & Mendes, 2020, pp. 317–320). In more modern iterations, ebselen analogues have been synthesized through convergent methodologies where diverse substituents are appended onto the benzisoselenazolone scaffold to tailor its biological activity (Crocetti et al., 2024, pp. 1–2; Durand, 2013, pp. 6–8). Ebselen belongs to the class of organoselenium heterocycles, a group of compounds known for their inherent redox activity, which derives from the presence of a selenium atom within a cyclic framework. This class has historically been used as antioxidants given their activity as mimics of the endogenous enzyme glutathione peroxidase (GPx); these compounds catalytically reduce hydroperoxides and intercept reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby protecting cellular components from oxidative damage (Crocetti et al., 2024, pp. 1–2; Bhabak & Mugesh, 2007, pp. 1–2). The fact that ebselen is a low-molecular-weight aromatic heterocycle with good lipid solubility contributes to its ability to cross biological barriers, a property that has facilitated its exploration across multiple therapeutic areas.

Therapeutic History:
Ebselen’s therapeutic history is extensive and multifaceted. Initially characterized for its GPx-mimetic activity, ebselen was investigated in biochemical studies that confirmed its capacity to catalyze the reduction of hydroperoxides by using endogenous thiols such as reduced glutathione (GSH) (Mugesh, du Mont, & Sies, 2001, pp. 3–4). Early preclinical studies, conducted in various animal models, demonstrated that ebselen could attenuate oxidative stress in organs such as the brain and liver, significantly reducing lipid peroxidation and inflammatory markers in models of ischemia-reperfusion injury and acute liver damage (Mugesh, du Mont, & Sies, 2001, pp. 3–4; Durand, 2013, pp. 6–8). Clinical efforts primarily centered on its use as a neuroprotective agent in stroke, with early clinical trials investigating its effects in acute middle cerebral artery occlusion. Though these trials provided some evidence of neuroprotective benefit and confirmed a favorable short-term safety profile, particularly due to its inability to release free selenium and resulting minimal toxicity, ebselen did not ultimately secure regulatory approval in these areas (Parnham & Sies, 2013, pp. 1–2, 4–5).

Beyond its application in neurologic injuries, ebselen has been evaluated in diverse fields such as inflammatory disorders and psychiatric conditions. For instance, its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory profile has led to studies investigating its potential utility in treatment-resistant depression and other neuropsychiatric disorders, capitalizing on its ability to modulate redox-dependent signaling pathways (Ramli, Cowen, & Godlewska, 2022, pp. 2–4; Pacuła et al., 2017, pp. 13–15). Additionally, investigations in non-neural tissues, including its effects on systemic inflammation and its role as a potential renoprotective and hepatoprotective agent, have been documented. Although numerous preclinical studies have shown that ebselen can reduce oxidative damage in models of chronic ethanol-induced injury in the retina or other tissues, there is to date no direct history of its clinical use in dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) or retinal disorders (Azad & Tomar, 2014, pp. 9–10; Aitken et al., 2012, pp. 1–2). Its exploration in ocular contexts has been largely inferred from its demonstrated capacity to lower oxidative stress in tissue models and its favorable barrier-crossing properties (Aitken et al., 2012, pp. 1–2; Pacuła et al., 2017, pp. 13–15). Thus, while ebselen has been extensively studied in non-ocular models – including its evaluation in ischemic brain injury and inflammatory conditions – its direct application to dry AMD remains untested in clinical trials, representing a new frontier for repurposing efforts.

Mechanism of Action:
On a molecular level, ebselen’s mechanism of action derives primarily from its ability to mimic the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), a critical enzyme responsible for the detoxification of hydroperoxides. This GPx-mimetic activity is enabled by the redox-active selenium atom that cycles between different oxidation states. In its catalytic cycle, ebselen initially reacts with reduced glutathione (GSH) to form a selenenyl sulfide intermediate; this intermediate undergoes subsequent reduction by additional equivalents of GSH to regenerate the original active selenol form of ebselen, thereby allowing it to continuously convert reactive hydroperoxides – for example, hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) and lipid hydroperoxides – into benign alcohol derivatives (Mugesh, du Mont, & Sies, 2001, pp. 3–4; Bhabak & Mugesh, 2007, pp. 1–2). In this redox cycle, the selenium atom cycles through oxidation states that include the selenol (–SeH), selenenic acid (–SeOH), and seleninic acid (–SeO₂H) forms; each of these states plays a specific role in intercepting and neutralizing reactive oxygen species, thereby maintaining cellular redox balance (Mugesh, du Mont, & Sies, 2001, pp. 3–4).

In addition to its catalytic behavior, ebselen exhibits reactivity toward protein thiol groups, forming reversible covalent bonds with reactive cysteine residues. This capacity to bind thiols can result in the protection or regulation of redox-sensitive enzymes, notably those found in lysosomal compartments. Lysosomal enzymes, which rely on free cysteine residues to maintain their catalytic function, are particularly vulnerable to oxidative modifications. Ebselen’s preferential binding to these thiol moieties may prevent oxidative inactivation of these enzymes, thereby preserving their function in the phagolysosomal degradation of photoreceptor debris – a process critical for retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell health (Azad & Tomar, 2014, pp. 8–9; Zhao & Holmgren, 2002, p. 39456).

Furthermore, ebselen is known to inhibit several key enzymes involved in the propagation of inflammatory responses, such as lipoxygenases and NADPH oxidases. Inhibition of these enzymes contributes to its anti-inflammatory effect by reducing the production of pro-inflammatory mediators and lowering the overall cellular oxidant burden. Consequently, ebselen functions at the intersection of antioxidant defence and inflammatory regulation, which positions it as a promising candidate for conditions where oxidative stress and chronic inflammation are underlying drivers of pathology (Parnham & Sies, 2013, pp. 3–4; Durand, 2013, pp. 6–8). Such dual functionality is pivotal in the context of dry AMD, where both oxidative stress and impaired waste clearance by RPE cells – resulting from lysosomal dysfunction – lead to the accumulation of photoreceptor byproducts and subsequent retinal degeneration.

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis driving the repurposing of ebselen for dry age-related macular degeneration is that its robust antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions can alleviate oxidative stress in RPE cells, thereby preserving lysosomal enzyme activity and promoting effective phagolysosomal degradation of photoreceptor debris. Dry AMD is characterized by chronic oxidative stress in the retinal pigment epithelium, which leads to lysosomal dysfunction, accumulation of drusen, and eventual RPE cell death. In this scenario, ebselen is expected to play several beneficial roles:

First, by virtue of its GPx-mimetic activity, ebselen will catalytically neutralize intracellular hydroperoxides and other ROS. This reduction in oxidant levels is anticipated to protect the cellular membranes, proteins, and nucleic acids of RPE cells from oxidative damage, thereby sustaining cell viability and function over time (Mugesh, du Mont, & Sies, 2001, pp. 3–4; Parnham & Sies, 2013, pp. 1–2). Reduced oxidative stress should in turn mitigate the secondary inflammatory responses that are typically observed in dry AMD.

Second, ebselen’s reactivity with protein thiol groups is expected to safeguard lysosomal enzymes from oxidative inactivation. In RPE cells, lysosomal function is crucial for the daily phagocytic clearance of shed photoreceptor outer segments. Oxidative modifications of key lysosomal enzymes impair this process, leading to the accumulation of cellular debris and the formation of drusen – hallmark features of dry AMD. By binding to the thiol groups of these enzymes, ebselen may prevent or reverse the deleterious oxidative modifications, thereby preserving lysosomal activity and restoring efficient phagolysosomal degradation (Azad & Tomar, 2014, pp. 8–9; Zhao & Holmgren, 2002, p. 39456).

Third, the molecular size and aromatic character of ebselen facilitate its ability to cross ocular barriers. Studies in other systems, particularly those investigating neuroprotective effects where ebselen is known to cross the blood–brain barrier, support the expectation that ebselen can similarly penetrate the ocular tissues to reach the RPE in therapeutically relevant concentrations (Pacuła et al., 2017, pp. 13–15; Aitken et al., 2012, pp. 1–2). Such penetration is essential for any drug candidate targeting the retina, given the complexity of the ocular barriers.

Moreover, the anti-inflammatory properties of ebselen are also expected to contribute to its therapeutic efficacy in dry AMD. By inhibiting enzymes such as lipoxygenases and NADPH oxidases, ebselen can decrease the synthesis and release of inflammatory cytokines and mediators that exacerbate tissue damage in the retina. A reduction in local inflammation is anticipated to create a more conducive environment for the recovery of RPE function, further enhancing phagocytic clearance mechanisms (Azad & Tomar, 2014, pp. 9–10; Aitken et al., 2012, pp. 1–2).

In a comprehensive preclinical assay designed to evaluate its effect in RPE cells, ebselen is expected to demonstrate a significant reduction in intracellular ROS levels, preservation or enhancement of lysosomal enzyme activity, and improved clearance of photoreceptor outer segment debris. This combination of outcomes should translate into a stabilization or even improvement in the functional health of the RPE layer – a key therapeutic goal in managing dry AMD. Additionally, because several of the proteins involved in phagocytosis and lysosomal function are known to be redox-sensitive, its ability to modulate the oxidative state indirectly supports the functional integrity of these cellular processes, further underlining its potential effectiveness in this indication.

Overall Evaluation:
In light of the chemical, biochemical, and pharmacological data, ebselen emerges as a strong candidate for repurposing in the treatment of dry age-related macular degeneration. One of the most compelling strengths of ebselen is its well-documented ability to mimic glutathione peroxidase activity, enabling it to function as a catalytic antioxidant that continuously reduces hydroperoxides and maintains cellular redox homeostasis (Mugesh, du Mont, & Sies, 2001, pp. 3–4; Bhabak & Mugesh, 2007, pp. 1–2). This antioxidant capacity is critical in the RPE, where oxidative stress is a major driver of lysosomal dysfunction and consequent photoreceptor debris accumulation, both of which underlie the pathogenesis of dry AMD.

Another notable strength is ebselen’s dual mechanism of action. In addition to its GPx-mimetic activity, its ability to form covalent bonds with protein thiols provides a potential means of protecting or restoring the function of redox-sensitive lysosomal enzymes. Given that impaired lysosomal degradation is central to the failure of RPE cells to properly clear photoreceptor outer segments, restoring this pathway is anticipated to mitigate drusen formation and the subsequent cascade of retinal degeneration (Azad & Tomar, 2014, pp. 8–9; Zhao & Holmgren, 2002, p. 39456).

Furthermore, the compound’s pharmacokinetic profile appears favorable. Its small, aromatic, and lipophilic structure increases the likelihood of efficient penetration across ocular barriers. Evidence from neuroprotective studies – where ebselen successfully crosses the blood–brain barrier – supports its potential to achieve effective retinal concentrations, a necessary prerequisite for any drug intended to treat retinal diseases (Pacuła et al., 2017, pp. 13–15; Aitken et al., 2012, pp. 1–2). Additionally, its safety profile established in clinical trials for neurologic and psychiatric disorders implies that chronic administration, as would be required in dry AMD management, might be feasible with minimal systemic toxicity (Parnham & Sies, 2013, pp. 4–5; Ramli, Cowen, & Godlewska, 2022, pp. 2–4).

However, there are several challenges and gaps that need to be addressed. Despite the compelling mechanistic rationale and supportive biochemical evidence from models of oxidative injury and inflammation, direct evidence of ebselen’s efficacy in established models of dry AMD is scarce. Although some studies using models of chronic ethanol-induced oxidative stress in the retina have indicated potential benefit, there is a translational gap between these indirect models and the complex pathology of dry AMD (Azad & Tomar, 2014, pp. 9–10; Aitken et al., 2012, pp. 1–2). Dedicated preclinical studies in animal models that more accurately recapitulate AMD pathology are required to establish its effectiveness in an ocular context.

Moreover, ebselen’s broad reactivity with thiol groups, while advantageous for preserving lysosomal enzyme activity, also poses a risk of off-target interactions. Its propensity to form covalent adducts with cysteine residues in other proteins might lead to unintended modulation of critical cellular processes in the highly specialized RPE cells. This non-specificity could potentially result in unwanted side effects, particularly over long-term treatment scenarios required for chronic diseases such as dry AMD (Durand, 2013, pp. 6–8; Abdur & Huang, 2016, pp. 98–102). Detailed toxicological studies on ocular tissues are therefore necessary to ensure that sustainable dosing does not compromise retinal integrity.

An additional challenge pertains to the current paucity of ocular pharmacokinetic data. Parameters such as retinal tissue penetration, intraocular half-life, and clearance rates are largely undefined for ebselen. Given that successful treatment of dry AMD requires maintaining therapeutic concentrations in the retina over extended periods, comprehensive ocular biodistribution studies are critical to optimize dosing regimens and determine the feasibility of different administration routes (Macegoniuk et al., 2023, pp. 9–10; May, 2015, pp. 93–95).

Finally, while the anti-inflammatory profile of ebselen is attractive, caution should be exercised due to the potential for broad immunomodulation. In the delicate microenvironment of the retina, where controlled inflammatory responses are essential for tissue remodeling and repair, any intervention that excessively suppresses inflammation could disrupt homeostatic processes. Therefore, the balance between antioxidant benefits and the risk of excessive anti-inflammatory suppression must be carefully calibrated in future studies.

In conclusion, ebselen presents a compelling profile as a candidate for repurposing in dry age-related macular degeneration. The robust mechanistic rationale – characterized by its GPx-mimetic activity, preservation of lysosomal enzyme function via thiol reactivity, and favorable physicochemical properties that support ocular penetration – aligns well with the key pathogenic processes underlying dry AMD. Although its therapeutic history does not include direct clinical application in ocular diseases, the extensive body of preclinical and clinical research in other contexts provides a strong foundation for further exploration.

To advance ebselen as a potential treatment for dry AMD, we recommend initiating a rigorous preclinical research program using well-established animal models of AMD. These studies should focus on determining the compound’s ocular pharmacokinetics, its effect on RPE cell oxidative status, lysosomal enzyme activity, and the efficiency of photoreceptor outer segment degradation. Detailed molecular assays to evaluate changes in redox-sensitive markers and inflammatory mediators in the retina will also be critical. Should these preclinical studies yield positive results, the promising safety profile of ebselen observed in CNS and psychiatric clinical trials would support the rationale for early-phase clinical trials in patients with dry AMD.

Overall, despite existing gaps in the direct evidence linking ebselen to improved outcomes in dry AMD, its multifaceted pharmacological profile, combined with a well-understood mechanism of action and favorable physicochemical properties, makes it a highly promising therapeutic candidate. Its repurposing could address the significant unmet medical need in dry AMD by targeting both oxidative stress and impaired phagolysosomal degradation, two central drivers of disease progression. Rigorous preclinical validation and targeted ocular pharmacokinetic studies will be essential next steps in determining whether ebselen can effectively translate its biochemical promise into clinical benefit for dry AMD patients (Parnham & Sies, 2013, pp. 3–4; Azad & Tomar, 2014, pp. 9–10; Aitken et al., 2012, pp. 1–2).
