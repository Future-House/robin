Query: Emerging novel chemical scaffolds or repurposed FDA-approved drugs with mechanistic specificity for stimulating RPE phagocytosis or autophagy, with data on target engagement, off-target profiling, and neuroprotective effects on photoreceptor survival in dry AMD-relevant systems

Metformin is one repurposed FDA‐approved drug that has been shown to stimulate RPE autophagy via AMPK pathway activation. In RPE cells, metformin indirectly increases autophagic flux by modulating the AMP/ATP ratio through complex I inhibition in the electron transport chain, which subsequently supports mitochondrial biogenesis likely through PGC-1α activation. Epidemiological studies link metformin usage to decreased odds of AMD, although its clinical impact on geographic atrophy has been limited (buonfiglio2024recentadvancesin pages 20-21).

Zinc supplementation is another promising approach that, while not a chemical scaffold in the classic sense, modulates RPE cell homeostasis. Zinc is highly enriched in RPE cells and plays a critical role in antioxidative and anti-inflammatory responses. Deficiency in zinc disrupts autophagic flux and complement regulation in these cells. Supplementation—often in combination with AREDS formulations—appears to slow AMD progression by activating the PGC-1α/Nrf2 axis, which in turn can enhance mitochondrial biogenesis and support autophagy. However, detailed off‐target profiling and direct target engagement data are still emerging for this strategy (buonfiglio2024recentadvancesin pages 20-21).

PU-91 is a repurposed FDA‐approved drug originally targeted for dyslipidemia that has demonstrated significant mitochondrial benefits in AMD cybrid models. Mechanistically, PU-91 enhances mitochondrial biogenesis, reduces oxidative stress, and improves complement inhibitory activity through activation of PGC-1α. Notably, when combined with quercetin, PU-91 upregulated protective markers such as SOD2 and modulated pro-inflammatory markers, although it also induced a senescent phenotype that requires further off‐target consideration. This duality underscores the need for comprehensive profiling as PU-91’s neuroprotective impact on photoreceptors continues to be evaluated in AMD-relevant systems (buonfiglio2024recentadvancesin pages 20-21).

Mitochondrial-derived peptides, such as humanin, represent a novel chemical scaffold with potential to stimulate autophagy in RPE cells while promoting neuroprotection. Humanin promotes mitochondrial biogenesis, alleviates ER stress, and suppresses ROS-mediated cell death. Formulations such as humanin encapsulated in chitosan nanoparticles have shown promising pharmacokinetics and biocompatibility by effectively preventing oxidative apoptosis in ARPE-19 cells—a widely used RPE model—thereby offering indirect protection to photoreceptors (buonfiglio2024recentadvancesin pages 20-21).

SkQ1 (also known as visomitin) is a mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant designed to counteract oxidative damage and ocular inflammation. Its mechanism involves reducing Aβ deposition and modulating proteins such as αB-crystallin as well as pathways like mTOR, which may indirectly favor autophagic processes. Preclinical models in rodents demonstrate that SkQ1 can suppress atrophic changes linked to AMD, thereby hinting at its potential to preserve photoreceptor survival (buonfiglio2024recentadvancesin pages 20-21).

Additionally, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), an NAD+ precursor, has been reported to enhance mitochondrial function and ATP production in RPE cells derived from AMD donors and to mitigate mitochondrial DNA damage alongside dampening inflammatory responses. These effects collectively support the notion that NMN can indirectly enhance both autophagy and neuroprotection of photoreceptors (buonfiglio2024recentadvancesin pages 20-21).

Finally, multiple compounds—including DMF, resveratrol, curcumin, and Panax ginseng berry extracts—have shown activity in preclinical models by engaging signaling pathways (Nrf2, SIRT1/PGC-1α) that enhance autophagic flux and promote mitochondrial health. However, for these molecules, detailed data on target engagement and off-target profiling are less clearly defined in the available literature (buonfiglio2024recentadvancesin pages 18-20).

In summary, emerging agents such as metformin, zinc supplementation, PU-91, humanin, SkQ1, and NMN exhibit mechanistic promise for stimulating RPE autophagy and protecting photoreceptors in dry AMD models, though further detailed pharmacological profiling and clinical validation remain necessary (buonfiglio2024recentadvancesin pages 20-21, buonfiglio2024recentadvancesin pages 18-20).
