Query: Experimental studies detailing the role of mitochondrial dysfunction, lysosomal impairment, and autophagy–lysosome pathway deficits in RPE cells derived from dry AMD patients, including demonstration of causality via rescue experiments using genetic modulation or small molecule enhancers of autophagy

Experimental evidence indicates that dry AMD is characterized by a confluence of mitochondrial dysfunction, lysosomal impairment, and autophagy–lysosome pathway deficits in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells. In vitro studies, including those using patient‐derived RPE models, demonstrate that AMD RPE cells exhibit reduced mitochondrial ATP production, altered energy metabolism with a compensatory shift toward glycolysis, and increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) – hallmarks of mitochondrial dysfunction. Electron microscopy and biochemical assays reveal disintegrated mitochondrial morphology and impaired mitophagy, suggesting that defective mitochondrial quality control plays a role in the pathogenesis of dry AMD (golestaneh2018dysfunctionalautophagyin pages 1-2, golestaneh2018dysfunctionalautophagyin pages 5-9).

Lysosomal impairments in these cells are evidenced by the accumulation of enlarged, dysfunctional lysosomes, excessive lipofuscin buildup, and abnormal LC3 processing with increased levels of p62, which collectively point to a blockade in autophagic flux. RPE cells in AMD show impaired degradation of photoreceptor outer segments, with lysosomal ion homeostasis disturbances—specifically in calcium and proton dynamics—that compromise lysosomal enzymatic activity and further hinder autophagic clearance (boya2023lysosomesinretinal pages 3-4, pinelli2020areappraisalof pages 6-9).

Several experimental studies have attempted to elucidate causality by modulating these pathways. For instance, genetic models in which key autophagy genes (e.g., ATG5 or ATG7) are deleted in RPE cells mimic AMD-like degeneration, solidifying the notion that impairments in autophagy can trigger RPE dysfunction (kaarniranta2023autophagyinagerelated pages 2-3). In parallel, pharmacological intervention studies have focused on small molecule enhancers; for example, AMPK activators like AICAR and Metformin have been evaluated in patient-derived iPSC-RPE cells, showing improvements in mitochondrial respiration parameters, though the responses were heterogeneous among patients (ebeling2022testingmitochondrialtargeteddrugs pages 9-11).

Other approaches have targeted the lysosomal system directly. Studies indicate that pharmacological agents aimed at optimizing lysosomal pH and modulating lysosomal calcium channels can restore autophagic flux, reduce the accumulation of toxic aggregates, and thereby alleviate some features of AMD pathology in RPE cells (boya2023lysosomesinretinal pages 8-9). Additionally, preclinical reports imply that activation of transcription factor EB (TFEB)—a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis—using small molecules such as trehalose can enhance autophagy and contribute to the restoration of mitochondrial function, even if these rescue experiments are primarily reported in photoreceptor or animal models rather than in RPE cells directly derived from dry AMD patients (kaarniranta2023autophagyinagerelated pages 3-5).

In another promising avenue, RPE-directed gene therapy has been employed to improve mitochondrial function, further suggesting that genetic modulation of mitochondrial pathways could serve as a therapeutic strategy against dry AMD (millingtonward2023rpedirectedgenetherapy pages 1-2).

Despite these advancements, the literature indicates that while there is compelling evidence linking mitochondrial and lysosomal dysfunction with autophagy deficits in AMD RPE cells, explicit rescue experiments directly demonstrating reversibility of the AMD phenotype in patient-derived cells via genetic modulation or small molecule enhancers remain limited. Collectively, these studies support the pathogenic role of impaired autophagy–lysosome pathways in dry AMD and underscore the need for further investigations to refine therapeutic strategies targeting these interconnected systems (golestaneh2018dysfunctionalautophagyin pages 9-10, kaarniranta2023autophagyinagerelated pages 1-2).
