Query: Genetic and functional evidence linking complement system dysregulation, inflammasome activation, and NLRP3-mediated inflammatory pathways to RPE cell death and disease progression in dry AMD patients, including GWAS studies, patient genotype–phenotype correlations, and mechanistic cell culture assays

Genetic evidence from genome‐wide association studies (GWAS) has robustly implicated complement system dysregulation as a central driver of dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD). Variants in key complement genes—including C3, CFI, CFD, C9, and C5—have been linked to disease risk, with C3 showing the highest association scores. These GWAS findings are further supported by genotype–phenotype correlations, such as the CFH Y402H polymorphism, which is associated with increased complement activation, altered extracellular deposition of complement components, and amplified inflammatory responses in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells (OpenTargets Search: dry AMD,dry age-related macular degeneration,geographic atrophy-NLRP3,complement system, armento2021thecomplementsystem pages 7-8, ebeling2021impairedmitochondrialfunction pages 16-18).

Functionally, dysregulated complement activity results in the generation of potent anaphylatoxins like C3a and C5a. These factors not only mediate local immune cell recruitment but also prime RPE cells for further inflammatory challenges. Specifically, exposure of RPE cells to C5a initiates a priming signal that upregulates pro-inflammatory cytokines and components of the inflammasome machinery. In cell culture models using ARPE-19 and primary fetal human RPE cells, C5a from complement-competent serum primes the RPE cells for the assembly and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome; this activation leads to the cleavage and secretion of IL-1β and IL-18, ultimately driving pyroptotic cell death (brandstetter2015complementcomponentc5a pages 2-3, brandstetter2015complementcomponentc5a pages 8-10).

Mechanistic assays further establish the link between complement dysregulation and inflammasome activation. Experimental systems have demonstrated that hallmark features of dry AMD—such as lipofuscin accumulation and photooxidative damage—can trigger complement-mediated priming of RPE cells. In these settings, complement activation facilitates a two-step process: an initial priming via NF-κB induction that elevates the transcription of NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β, followed by a second signal from danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) or lysosomal destabilization that drives inflammasome assembly and caspase-1 activation (chakuroff2018theeffectof pages 13-19, gao2015nlrp3inflammasomeactivation pages 4-5).

The downstream consequences of this process are critical for disease progression. Activated caspase-1 processes pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their mature forms, which not only exacerbate local inflammation but also induce pyroptotic cell death of RPE cells. The resulting cell loss and tissue degeneration contribute to the progression of geographic atrophy, the advanced stage of dry AMD (gao2018evidenceforthe pages 12-12, korhonen2024inflammasomeactivationin pages 82-84).

In parallel, studies have linked mitochondrial dysfunction in RPE cells—particularly in cells harboring high-risk complement genotypes—with an impaired bioenergetic state and increased oxidative stress. This mitochondrial compromise further predisposes cells to complement-mediated inflammatory activation and subsequent inflammasome assembly, thereby reinforcing the cycle of chronic inflammation and RPE degeneration (ebeling2021impairedmitochondrialfunction pages 16-18, gao2015nlrp3inflammasomeactivation pages 6-7).

Overall, the convergence of genetic predisposition (as evidenced by GWAS and patient genotype–phenotype studies), complement system dysregulation, and NLRP3 inflammasome activation forms a coherent pathogenic mechanism in dry AMD. In vitro mechanistic cell culture assays have provided detailed insights by recapitulating the conditions under which complement activation primes RPE cells for inflammasome–mediated inflammatory cytokine release and programmed cell death. This integrated body of evidence not only elucidates the molecular and cellular events underlying RPE degeneration in dry AMD but also provides a rational framework for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions aimed at modulating complement activity and inflammasome activation to prevent or slow disease progression (korhonen2024inflammasomeactivationin pages 84-86, korhonen2024inflammasomeactivationin pages 86-87).
