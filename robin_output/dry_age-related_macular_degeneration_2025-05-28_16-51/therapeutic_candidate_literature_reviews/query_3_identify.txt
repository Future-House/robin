Query: Identify studies on modulation of MERTK, CD36, integrin αvβ5 receptor pathways in RPE phagocytosis assays: prioritize target validation by genetic knockdown or gain-of-function, demonstration of enhanced clearance in disease-relevant RPE models, detailed mechanism-of-action confirmation, and animal safety profiles

Several studies in the literature have systematically modulated key receptor pathways in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) phagocytosis, focusing on MERTK, CD36, and integrin αvβ5, with robust target validation achieved through genetic knockdown, knockout, or gain‐of‐function approaches.

Regarding MERTK, several reports have established its central role in RPE phagocytosis by using genetic models. For example, the work by Albert et al. demonstrated that a mutation in the Mertk receptor—first identified in the RCS rat—is directly linked to defective clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) in RPE cells, thereby confirming MERTK’s critical function in retinal health via genetic disruption (albert2015triamcinoloneregulatedapoptophagocytic pages 12-12). Further, Moran et al. provided mechanistic insight by employing genetic knockout models to dissect TAM receptor–ligand interactions, illustrating that loss-of-function mutations in MERTK lead to impaired phagocytosis and retinal dystrophy in vivo (moran2022regulationofthe pages 16-18). In addition, Lieffrig et al. used MERTK knockout mouse models not only to confirm the phagocytic failure but also to reveal compensatory mechanisms by related receptors such as TYRO3; this study also assessed pro-inflammatory gene activation as a safety and functional readout relevant to retinal degeneration (lieffrig2023clearancephagocytosisby pages 35-37, lieffrig2023clearancephagocytosisby pages 19-20). Complementing these preclinical validations, the phase I clinical trial NCT01482195 applied subretinal gene therapy to restore MERTK function in patients with retinitis pigmentosa, with detailed safety assessments demonstrating acceptable systemic and ocular profiles over a two-year follow-up (NCT01482195).

In the case of integrin αvβ5, several lines of evidence support its role in mediating the initial binding and signaling events that precede POS internalization by RPE cells. Albert et al. showed that the loss of synchronized retinal phagocytosis in models lacking αvβ5 integrin leads to impaired POS clearance, confirming integrin αvβ5’s indispensability through genetic knockdown approaches in mice (albert2015triamcinoloneregulatedapoptophagocytic pages 12-12). Moran et al. further validated this target by demonstrating that knockout of integrin αvβ5 or its ligand MFG-E8 produces a similar phagocytic defect, and that downstream signaling via focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is crucial for proper receptor functioning (moran2022regulationofthe pages 16-18). Moreover, Parinot et al. utilized recombinant ligands and siRNA controls in their RPE phagocytosis assays to further confirm the participation of αvβ5 integrin in a mechanism-of-action context, reinforcing the concept that genetic manipulation can modulate this pathway (parinot2024gas6andprotein pages 14-15).

For CD36, the evidence, while partly derived from pharmacological modulation, also includes genetic approaches. Yang et al. provided genetic knockdown data in mouse models, where suppression of CD36 expression resulted in reduced POS internalization, thereby validating its role in RPE clearance mechanisms (yang2022thepastand pages 8-10). In addition, Mellal et al. examined the effects of the CD36 ligand MPE-001 in photo-oxidative stress models to attenuate inflammation and preserve photoreceptor integrity; although this study focused on pharmacological modulation rather than direct genetic manipulation, it nonetheless confirms that CD36 is a viable target for modulating RPE function (mellal2019immunometabolicmodulationof pages 9-11).

Mechanistic studies across these reports have provided detailed pathway elucidation. The interplay between integrins and MERTK is highlighted by the observation that αvβ5-mediated binding and FAK activation precedes MERTK-triggered internalization, thus defining a sequential and cooperative mechanism (albert2015triamcinoloneregulatedapoptophagocytic pages 12-12, moran2022regulationofthe pages 16-18). Furthermore, animal safety profiles are addressed by using knockout models that present not only functional deficits but also specific inflammatory signatures and retinal degeneration outcomes, thereby allowing for the assessment of both efficacy and safety in disease-relevant settings (lieffrig2023clearancephagocytosisby pages 35-37, NCT01482195).

In summary, the combined evidence from genetic knockout/knockdown studies, gain-of-function models, and clinical safety assessments establishes that modulation of MERTK, CD36, and integrin αvβ5 receptor pathways significantly affects POS clearance in RPE cells, with detailed mechanistic insights and preclinical safety data supporting these targets for therapeutic intervention (albert2015triamcinoloneregulatedapoptophagocytic pages 12-12, moran2022regulationofthe pages 16-18, lieffrig2023clearancephagocytosisby pages 35-37, parinot2024gas6andprotein pages 14-15, ramsden2017usingstemcells pages 40-47, yang2022thepastand pages 8-10, NCT01482195).
