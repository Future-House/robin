Query: Explore the interplay between RPE cell senescence, autophagy-lysosome pathway decline, and microglial activation in the retinal microenvironment of dry AMD: emphasize mechanistic studies validating these interactions, their contribution to photoreceptor degeneration, and identification of nodal targets for therapeutic enhancement of phagocytosis

RPE cell senescence, autophagy-lysosome pathway decline, and microglial activation together create a self‐reinforcing pathogenic network that drives photoreceptor degeneration in dry AMD. Mechanistic studies have validated that RPE cell senescence is marked by reduced proliferative capacity, increased oxidative damage, and impaired degradation of photoreceptor outer segment (POS) debris. Senescent RPE cells are less effective in phagocytosis and instead secrete a senescence‐associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that exacerbates local inflammation, thereby sensitizing the retinal microenvironment to additional damage (ao2018retinalpigmentepithelium pages 10-14, pinelli2020areappraisalof pages 6-9).

A key contributor to this process is the decline in the autophagy-lysosome pathway. Under normal physiological conditions, RPE cells rely on lysosomes to maintain proteostasis by degrading damaged proteins, oxidized lipids, and POS through macroautophagy and LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP). However, chronic oxidative stress and aging impair lysosomal enzyme activity and decrease autophagic flux, leading to lipofuscin accumulation. Lipofuscin, rich in A2E and other bis-retinoids, further disrupts lysosomal pH and causes lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP), thereby releasing cathepsins that promote cell death pathways (boya2023lysosomesinretinal pages 3-4, boya2023lysosomesinretinal pages 4-6).

These autophagy deficits have been mechanistically linked to RPE cell senescence. As autophagic clearance becomes increasingly inefficient due to impaired mTORC1 regulation, altered TFEB activity, and defective lysosomal biogenesis, the build-up of cellular debris and damaged organelles reinforces senescent processes (kozhevnikova2019disruptionsofautophagy pages 12-14, ao2018retinalpigmentepithelium pages 14-19). In animal models of AMD-like retinopathy, reduced autophagic flux is accompanied by morphological changes in the RPE, with overt accumulation of lipofuscin and disrupted phagosome-lysosome fusion, thereby validating that autophagy decline is a critical nodal point in the progression of dry AMD (kozhevnikova2019disruptionsofautophagy pages 19-20).

Microglial activation further compounds these deleterious effects. In a healthy retina, microglia perform immune surveillance and phagocytose debris; however, in a senescent retinal microenvironment burdened with accumulation of toxic aggregates and pro-inflammatory signals, microglia become chronically activated. This activation is driven by signals such as increased ROS production, release of DAMPs from dysfunctional RPE cells, and complement cascade dysregulation, which together stimulate microglial recruitment and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (wang2019autophagydysfunctioncellular pages 8-9, blasiak2019interplaybetweenautophagy pages 9-10). The activated microglia then contribute to a harmful feedback loop by further promoting oxidative stress and releasing additional cytokines, thereby accelerating photoreceptor cell loss secondary to RPE dysfunction (ao2018retinalpigmentepithelium pages 10-14, wang2019autophagydysfunctioncellular pages 9-10).

Given this complex interplay, several nodal targets have emerged for therapeutic intervention aimed at enhancing phagocytosis in the retinal microenvironment. Therapeutic strategies include restoration of autophagic flux by inhibiting mTORC1 using agents such as rapamycin, enhancing lysosomal function via upregulation of TFEB, and stabilizing lysosomal membranes with compounds that boost Hsp70 activity. Additionally, reactivation of proper phagocytic receptor-ligand interactions (such as via stimulation of MerTK or CD36) may improve POS clearance. Modulating microglial activation through inhibition of key inflammatory signaling cascades—such as targeting NF-κB and complement pathways—may also help restore retinal homeostasis (pinelli2020areappraisalof pages 15-17, blasiak2019interplaybetweenautophagy pages 1-4, boya2023lysosomesinretinal pages 13-14).

In summary, mechanistic studies indicate that the convergence of RPE cell senescence, autophagy-lysosome decline, and microglial activation creates a vicious cycle leading to photoreceptor degeneration in dry AMD. Interventions that restore autophagic flux, improve lysosomal degradation capacities, and limit microglial-driven inflammation offer promising therapeutic avenues for enhancing phagocytosis and preserving retinal function (ao2018retinalpigmentepithelium pages 14-19, boya2023lysosomesinretinal pages 6-8, wang2019autophagydysfunctioncellular pages 1-2).
