Query: Comprehensive reviews and primary research on the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying dry age-related macular degeneration, focusing on RPE dysfunction, lipofuscin accumulation, oxidative stress pathways, and impaired clearance of photoreceptor outer segments in human donor tissues and cell models

Dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) is widely recognized as a multifactorial degenerative disorder defined by retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) dysfunction, lipofuscin accumulation, oxidative stress, and impaired clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (POS). The RPE, a highly specialized monolayer of polarized epithelial cells, is responsible for a spectrum of essential functions including nutrient transport, secretion of trophic factors, and most notably the daily phagocytosis of shed POS—a process that is markedly dysregulated in dry AMD (Basyal2024antioxidantsandmechanistic pages 4-5).

Age‐related deterioration of the RPE is characterized by both structural and functional deficits. Morphological changes such as decreased melanin content, microvilli atrophy, and thinning of the cell layer compromise the RPE’s capacity to support photoreceptor cells. Concurrently, accumulation of cellular waste—including damaged proteins and lipid peroxidation products—due to impaired ubiquitin proteasome and autophagy pathways further deteriorates RPE function, setting the stage for progressive retinal degeneration (Cardoso2018stemcellderivedretinal pages 34-37, Lynn2018aninvestigationof pages 59-62).

Lipofuscin is a hallmark of aging in RPE cells and results from incomplete degradation of phagocytosed POS. Comprised of oxidized lipid and protein residues, lipofuscin builds up with age and is particularly enriched in the metabolically demanding macular region. This accumulation not only reflects previous oxidative damage but also actively contributes to cellular stress by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon exposure to blue light, thereby exacerbating photo-oxidative injury and further impairing lysosomal function (Chen2023oxidativestressin pages 1-1).

Oxidative stress is a central mechanism in dry AMD pathogenesis, where elevated levels of ROS produced during mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, photic stimulation, and phagocytosis overwhelm the endogenous antioxidant defenses of the RPE. The chronic oxidative insult damages DNA, proteins, and lipids, and disrupts mitochondrial integrity, leading to further ROS generation. This self-perpetuating cycle of oxidative injury guides damaging inflammatory responses, as seen by the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and complement cascade components, enhancing neurodegenerative processes (Chen2023oxidativestressin pages 1-2, Nita2023antioxidativeroleof pages 23-25).

Impaired clearance of photoreceptor outer segments exacerbates this pathological environment. The efficiency of POS phagocytosis in RPE cells depends on tightly regulated receptor–ligand interactions, such as those mediated by integrin αvβ5/MFG-E8 and MerTK with its ligands protein S and Gas6. Dysfunctions in these interactions, which can result either from direct oxidative modification of receptors or from deficiencies in downstream processing mechanisms like autophagy and lysosomal degradation, lead to the occlusion of the phagocytic pathway. This impairment results in the accumulation of oxidized debris and aggregates, further promoting intracellular toxicity and drusen formation beneath the RPE (Basyal2024antioxidantsandmechanistic pages 5-7, Iliescu2024nonneovascularagerelatedmacular pages 2-3).

Mitochondrial dysfunction further compounds these effects. Disruption in mitochondrial dynamics—characterized by imbalances in fusion and fission as well as impaired mitophagy—reduces ATP production and increases ROS generation, hence reinforcing the cycle of oxidative and metabolic stress in RPE cells (Buonfiglio2024recentadvancesin pages 10-12, Lenin2023dysfunctionalautophagyproteostasis pages 2-4).

In summary, comprehensive reviews and primary research on dry AMD reveal that RPE dysfunction, driven by oxidative stress and impaired clearance of photoreceptor outer segments, leads to the accumulation of lipofuscin and compromised cellular homeostasis. These disturbances not only exacerbate RPE degeneration but also accelerate photoreceptor loss and overall retinal dysfunction. The corroborative evidence from human donor tissues and cell model studies underscores the need for therapeutic strategies targeting antioxidant defense, restoration of autophagic and phagocytic functions, and the improvement of mitochondrial health to slow disease progression (Buonfiglio2024recentadvancesin pages 9-10).
