Query: Investigations into the interplay between complement-mediated sub-RPE deposit formation (drusen), local inflammatory milieu, and consequent impairment of RPE phagocytic and autophagic processes in early versus late dry AMD stages, with focus on therapeutic window identification

The current body of evidence supports a model in which dysregulated complement activation initiates sub–retinal pigment epithelium (sub-RPE) deposit (drusen) formation, establishes a localized inflammatory milieu, and impairs the RPE’s capacity for phagocytosis and autophagy. In early dry AMD, complement components—chiefly C3 and C5—are aberrantly activated beneath the RPE, contributing to drusen formation composed in part of these proteins and associated membrane attack complex (MAC) fragments (armento2021thecomplementsystem pages 4-5). This early complement-triggered process not only recruits immune cells but also produces inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, thereby creating a local environment of chronic, low-grade inflammation that directly impacts RPE functionality (wilke2024complementregulationin pages 1-2).

Genetic risk factors, including polymorphisms in complement regulatory genes like complement factor H (CFH), predispose patients to an exaggerated complement response that further accentuates drusen accumulation and inflammation at the sub-RPE space (armento2021thecomplementsystem pages 7-8, wilke2024complementregulationin pages 5-6). This early stage is characterized by a delicate balance in which complement activation initially functions as part of a protective para-inflammatory response; however, once dysregulated, it disrupts critical RPE processes. Specifically, the RPE’s phagocytic clearance of photoreceptor outer segments and autophagic degradation of damaged proteins and organelles become impeded, leading to an accumulation of waste and an escalated inflammatory cascade (fernandezgodino2018changesinextracellular pages 1-5, pinelli2020areappraisalof pages 9-11).

The interplay between complement activity and RPE dysfunction in early AMD defines a critical therapeutic window. Early intervention with complement inhibitors—targeting central molecules such as C3 and C5—could attenuate this inflammatory cascade, reduce drusen buildup, and thereby preserve RPE phagocytic and autophagic functions. By restoring the homeostatic balance of the RPE, these interventions have the potential to forestall the progression of AMD before irreversible cellular damage occurs (wilke2024complementregulationin pages 2-3, fernandezgodino2018c3atriggersformation pages 12-12).

As the disease advances from early to late dry AMD, sustained complement activation leads to cumulative RPE damage, evidenced by widespread impairment in both phagocytosis and autophagy. In late stages, the chronic inflammatory milieu, augmented by oxidative stress and extracellular matrix remodeling, results in extensive RPE cell atrophy and photoreceptor degeneration, which characterize geographic atrophy. At this juncture, the loss of cellular clearance mechanisms is largely irreversible, thereby limiting the efficacy of strategies that solely target complement inhibition (pinelli2020areappraisalof pages 9-11, kaarniranta2023autophagyinagerelated pages 1-2).

The data further indicate that the inflammatory environment is not solely driven by complement activity but is also reinforced by a parainflammatory state and cellular senescence, collectively exacerbating RPE dysfunction and drusen maturation (khan2023beyondthecomplement pages 2-3). Moreover, these findings suggest that combination therapies addressing complement dysregulation, restoring efficient autophagic flux, and mitigating local immune activation may be required to achieve significant clinical benefit, particularly in advanced disease stages (khan2023beyondthecomplement pages 15-16).

In summary, the pathogenic cascade of dry AMD begins with complement-mediated drusen formation that initiates a local inflammatory environment impairing RPE phagocytic and autophagic processes. Early intervention aimed at modulating complement activity represents a promising therapeutic window that could halt or decelerate disease progression, whereas later stages characterized by extensive RPE loss may necessitate regenerative approaches alongside anti-inflammatory and autophagy-restoring strategies (wilke2024complementregulationin pages 5-6, armento2021thecomplementsystem pages 4-5).
