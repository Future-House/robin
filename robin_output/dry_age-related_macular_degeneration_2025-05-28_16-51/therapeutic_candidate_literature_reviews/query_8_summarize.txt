Query: Summarize evidence linking complement system dysregulation, drusen biogenesis, and chronic inflammation to RPE phagocytosis deficits in early dry AMD: highlight studies with genetic validation of complement factors, functional assays in RPE cultures, and therapeutic modulation outcomes in preclinical models

Genetic evidence implicating complement dysfunction in early dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) is extensive. Both common and rare variants in complement factor H (CFH), complement factor I (CFI), and complement component 3 (C3) have been robustly linked to increased AMD susceptibility. For instance, the widely studied CFH Y402H polymorphism is known to impair binding to glycosaminoglycans in Bruch’s membrane, thereby compromising local regulation of complement activation. Familial cases of early onset macular drusen and AMD have been observed in carriers of rare CFH variants, with similar associations also reported for rare CFI variants that lower systemic factor I levels, alongside common genetic risk scores that further exacerbate disease risk (OpenTargets Search: age-related macular degeneration-complement factor H,complement factor I,complement component 3; armento2021thecomplementsystem pages 7-8). Moreover, genome-wide association studies have reinforced the genetic validation of these complement factors by consistently identifying risk associations across independent cohorts, linking these genes directly to both early and late stages of AMD (armento2021thecomplementsystem pages 10-11, bora2015relationshipbetweenthe pages 2-3).

Functional assays in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cultures provide complementary evidence that complement overactivation contributes to RPE dysfunction. In vitro studies using patient-derived or genetically engineered RPE cells have demonstrated that dysregulated complement activation leads to increased deposition of activation fragments such as C3b, along with local formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC). These events are associated with defects in phagocytosis, a critical function of RPE cells responsible for clearing photoreceptor outer segments and cellular debris. RPE cells exposed to complement overactivation exhibit impaired phagocytic capacity and increased oxidative stress, which is further compounded by the accumulation of drusen—lipid- and protein-rich deposits that serve as a nidus for chronic inflammation. Additionally, modulation in the expression of complement regulators, such as reduced levels of CD46, CD55, and CD59 in stressed RPE cells, has been observed, thereby accentuating their reduced resilience against complement-mediated injury (armento2021thecomplementsystem pages 8-10, behnke2020theroleof pages 4-5).

Therapeutic modulation in preclinical models has provided promising evidence that targeting complement dysregulation may restore RPE function and slow disease progression. Experimental models, including transgenic mice carrying human complement risk alleles, have shown that inhibition of complement activation—whether through genetic deletion of key components like C3 or pharmacological intervention using complement inhibitors such as CR2-fH—leads to reduced drusen formation, diminished chronic inflammation, and improved RPE phagocytosis. For example, preclinical studies have demonstrated that complement inhibition alleviates complement deposition on Bruch’s membrane and mitigates downstream inflammatory responses that drive RPE dysfunction, effectively preserving retinal homeostasis (patel2022targetingthecomplement pages 4-6, kassa2019complementinhibitionas pages 1-7). Furthermore, interventions that target the terminal pathway, such as C5 inhibition, have also been investigated and show beneficial outcomes in reducing complement-mediated cytotoxicity and inflammation, further reinforcing the therapeutic potential of complement pathway modulation (toomey2018complementfactorh pages 14-16, toomey2018complementfactorh pages 17-19).

In summary, the collective body of evidence—from robust genetic associations identifying CFH, CFI, and C3 variants, through functional assays that elucidate impaired RPE phagocytosis under chronic complement activation, to preclinical models where complement inhibition restores RPE function and curbs drusen formation—strongly supports the central role of complement dysregulation as a pathogenic driver of early dry AMD. This integrative understanding not only underscores the mechanistic link between complement-mediated chronic inflammation and RPE deficits but also provides a rational basis for developing targeted complement-based therapies for early AMD.
