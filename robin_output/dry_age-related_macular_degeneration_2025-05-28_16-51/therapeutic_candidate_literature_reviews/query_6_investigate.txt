Query: Investigate comprehensive molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying phagocytic dysfunction in RPE cells during dry AMD progression: review genetic associations, transcriptomic and proteomic dysregulation of phagocytosis regulators, lysosomal impairment, and validation in patient retinal tissues or advanced in vitro RPE systems

Dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) is characterized by a multifactorial basis in which genetic predispositions, transcriptomic and proteomic dysregulation, and lysosomal impairment converge to produce significant dysfunction of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) phagocytic capacity. This dysfunction disrupts the daily clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) and contributes to cellular stress, extracellular deposit formation, and ultimately RPE degeneration (OpenTargets Search: Dry Age-related Macular Degeneration).

Genetic association studies have identified key risk loci that significantly impact RPE function in AMD. Variants in complement pathway genes—most notably C3 and complement factor H (CFH)—have been repeatedly associated with dry AMD, with robust evidence suggesting that impaired regulation of complement activation leads to chronic inflammation and exacerbates phagocytic deficits (hernandez2025roleofoxidative pages 11-13). Additionally, the ARMS2 locus, along with lipid metabolism–related genes such as APOE, NR5A2, LIPC, COL10A1, ZNF385B, and CSMD3, have been implicated in modulating immune responses and extracellular matrix remodeling, thereby further influencing the RPE’s ability to maintain proper clearance of POS (garciaquintanilla2022recentadvancesin pages 1-2).

On a molecular level, transcriptomic and proteomic studies have revealed that dysregulation of phagocytosis regulators plays a critical role in AMD progression. Key players in receptor-mediated phagocytosis—including integrins such as αvβ5 and receptor tyrosine kinases like MerTK—demonstrate altered expression profiles in diseased RPE cells. Such changes compromise the binding and ingestion of POS and disrupt downstream signaling required for phagosome maturation and lysosomal degradation (inana2018rpephagocyticfunction pages 13-14). Complementary evidence from large‐scale transcriptomic analyses further underscores that dysregulated expression of proteins governing autophagy and proteolysis correlates with impaired clearance mechanisms in RPE cells (senabouth2022transcriptomicandproteomic pages 1-4).

Lysosomal impairment is a central feature in the cascade leading to phagocytic dysfunction within RPE cells. Age-related accumulation of lipofuscin—a lipid–protein aggregate that can inhibit lysosomal enzymes—leads to elevated lysosomal pH and reduced proteolytic efficiency, thereby hindering degradation of photoreceptor debris (ferrington2016defectsinretinal pages 16-17). Compounding this issue, chronic oxidative stress mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) further disrupts lysosomal function and triggers a senescence-associated secretory phenotype, which promotes a sustained inflammatory environment detrimental to RPE survival (hernandez2025roleofoxidative pages 4-6). Loss of lysosomal integrity thus represents both a consequence and a driver of defective phagocytosis and cellular degeneration in dry AMD (si2023theroleof pages 2-4).

Critically, these molecular insights have been supported and validated in both patient retinal tissues and advanced in vitro RPE systems. Studies employing human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)–derived RPE cells have recapitulated key features of AMD, including aberrant expression of phagocytosis regulators and lysosomal proteins, thereby reinforcing the mechanistic links derived from genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data (senabouth2022transcriptomicandproteomic pages 17-20). In parallel, clinical analyses of retinal samples have confirmed the presence of complement dysregulation and impaired phagocytosis, bridging experimental findings with disease pathology observed in patients (pinelli2020areappraisalof pages 3-4, si2023theroleof pages 1-2).

Overall, genetic risk factors predispose RPE cells to dysregulated complement activity, oxidative stress, and impaired lysosomal function, which converge to disrupt the molecular machinery essential for efficient phagocytosis. Multilayered validation using patient-derived tissues and advanced in vitro models corroborates this integrated model of AMD pathogenesis, thus providing both a framework for understanding disease progression and potential targets for therapeutic intervention (meyer2019proteomeandsecretome pages 10-11).
