Query: Studies reporting small molecule screening hits that improve RPE phagocytic capacity in disease-relevant animal models of dry AMD, such as Cfh⁻/⁻ mice or sodium iodate-induced RPE degeneration, with emphasis on target identification, dose–response, and functional restoration of outer segment ingestion

Studies in dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) models have focused primarily on REV-ERBα as a target to mitigate oxidative damage and associated RPE dysfunction, including impaired phagocytosis. In one key study, pharmacological activation of REV-ERBα with synthetic agonists such as SR9009 and SR9011 was shown to confer cytoprotection in RPE cells subjected to oxidative challenges. In vitro experiments using ARPE-19 cells demonstrated that treatment with these REV-ERBα agonists after paraquat-induced stress not only improved mitochondrial respiration—suggesting restoration of mitochondrial function—but also enhanced phagocytic activity, which is critical in maintaining outer segment clearance by RPE cells (huang2022reverbαregulatesagerelated pages 6-7).

The same investigation highlights an important mechanistic link: REV-ERBα functions upstream of NRF2, a transcription factor that regulates antioxidant defenses. REV-ERBα-mediated upregulation of NRF2 leads to increased expression of downstream enzymes such as SOD1 and catalase, thereby countering oxidative stress. Although the direct measurement of outer segment ingestion was not elaborated in every experimental condition, REV-ERBα deficiency in mice resulted in a threefold reduction in the ingestion of cone outer segments—an impairment considered to be a mechanistic contributor to AMD progression (huang2022reverbαregulatesagerelated pages 3-4). This evidence indirectly supports the rationale that REV-ERBα agonists could therapeutically restore phagocytic function altered by oxidative injury.

In vivo, administration of SR9009 at a dose of 100 mg/kg twice daily in sodium iodate-induced models of RPE oxidative damage significantly reduced both the area of RPE lesions (by approximately 60%) and cell death (by nearly 50%). The beneficial outcomes of the agonist treatment tie directly to improved antioxidant defenses and cell survival in the retina, even though details on the precise restoration of outer segment ingestion in these chemical injury models were not explicitly provided (huang2022reverbαregulatesagerelated pages 6-7, huang2022reverbαregulatesagerelated pages 10-11).

Notably, while the sodium iodate model is widely employed to mimic dry AMD by chemically inducing RPE degeneration, there is insufficient evidence in the current literature regarding small molecule screening hits that improve RPE phagocytic capacity specifically in complement factor H knockout (Cfh⁻/⁻) mice. The bulk of the data instead concentrate on the REV-ERBα pathway where target identification is clear—REV-ERBα acts via transcriptional activation of NRF2—and dose–response characteristics have been partially defined in the sodium iodate-induced model with effective in vivo protection observed at 100 mg/kg dosed intraperitoneally (huang2022reverbαregulatesagerelated pages 6-7, chen2023oxidativestressin pages 5-5).

Thus, current evidence supports the use of REV-ERBα agonists as promising small molecules that improve RPE cellular parameters, including phagocytic function, in oxidative stress contexts relevant to dry AMD. However, while these studies describe robust target identification, partial dose–response information, and restoration of key RPE functions, detailed functional restoration of outer segment ingestion—particularly in genetically defined models such as Cfh⁻/⁻ mice—remains an area requiring further investigation (huang2022reverbαregulatesagerelated pages 3-4, huang2022reverbαregulatesagerelated pages 11-12).
