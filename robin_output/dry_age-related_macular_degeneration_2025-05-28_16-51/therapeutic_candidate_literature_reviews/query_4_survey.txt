Query: Survey literature on repurposed FDA-approved small molecules assessed for restoring RPE phagocytic function using high-throughput fluorescence assays: focus on mechanistic specificity, demonstration of subretinal delivery and distribution, pharmacokinetic properties in primate or rodent ocular tissues, and any published human safety data

The literature on repurposed FDA‐approved small molecules for restoring retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) phagocytic function presents promising mechanistic rationales for neuroprotection and RPE homeostasis; however, none of the surveyed studies provide a comprehensive evaluation using high‐throughput fluorescence assays specifically designed to quantify restoration of RPE phagocytic activity.

Several reports highlight that repurposed compounds—such as metformin, complement inhibitors, and agents like L‑DOPA—exhibit mechanistic specificity in modulating pathways relevant to RPE degeneration. For example, metformin hydrochloride is noted for its ability to stimulate macroautophagy in the RPE via AMP‑activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation. This mechanism not only helps reduce lipid and lipofuscin accumulation in animal models of Stargardt disease but has also led to clinical investigations over 24 months, suggesting a potential secondary neuroprotective role (plau2024ligandinteractionsand pages 39-44, das2022drugdiscoverystrategies pages 16-17). Similarly, complement factor C5 inhibitors such as Avacincaptad pegol are being evaluated for their anti‐inflammatory effects in dry AMD and Stargardt disease, although adverse effects on long‑term use have been noted (plau2024ligandinteractionsand pages 39-44). Other agents like L‑DOPA are hypothesized to modulate RPE functions by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion and reducing inflammation, yet these observations come from epidemiological studies and pilot investigations, rather than from fluorescence‐based screening for phagocytic function (marchesi2024differenttherapeuticapproaches pages 19-20).

A number of studies originating from diverse approaches, including systems pharmacology and high‑throughput phenotypic screening platforms, have been successful in evaluating photoreceptor survival and protein stabilization via fluorescence‐based assays (das2022drugdiscoverystrategies pages 3-5, das2022drugdiscoverystrategies pages 6-8). Nonetheless, none of these specifically target the RPE phagocytic pathway using high‐throughput fluorescence readouts. This represents an important gap because, while fluorescence‐assay‐based methods are well established for assessing other aspects of retinal cell biology, their application to quantifying the restoration of RPE phagocytic function in response to repurposed FDA‐approved drugs remains underdeveloped (sparrow2016vitaminaaldehydeadducts pages 5-6).

Regarding subretinal delivery and ocular pharmacokinetics, the available literature provides only preliminary insights into drug distribution and tissue retention. Many studies have leveraged animal models, including Abca4 knockout mice and dKO mice of AMD, to approximate subretinal delivery routes and ocular tissue distribution; however, detailed pharmacokinetic properties in primate or rodent ocular tissues are sparsely documented. For instance, while metformin’s effects have been evident in murine models and its known human safety profile supports systemic repurposing, dedicated studies describing its subretinal pharmacokinetic profile remain limited (plau2024ligandinteractionsand pages 39-44, marchesi2024differenttherapeuticapproaches pages 30-30). Similarly, other therapeutic candidates evaluated in systems pharmacology frameworks or preclinical rodent models have not been accompanied by explicit data on subretinal distribution or ocular tissue pharmacokinetics (luu2024…approachto pages 158-159, luu2024…approachto pages 24-28).

Finally, although these repurposed drugs carry established human safety data based on their original indications (e.g., metformin in diabetes, L‑DOPA in Parkinson’s disease, statins for hypercholesterolemia), published human safety data directly relevant to their ocular administration and specific evaluation for restoring RPE phagocytic function are not available. This represents a translational gap that must be addressed in future clinical studies (marchesi2024differenttherapeuticapproaches pages 19-20, marchesi2024differenttherapeuticapproaches pages 30-30).

In summary, while the mechanistic underpinnings supporting the repurposing of certain FDA‑approved drugs for retinal protection are compelling, the literature to date does not supply robust high‑throughput fluorescence assay data specifically assessing RPE phagocytic function, nor does it provide detailed insights into subretinal delivery, ocular pharmacokinetics in animal models, or targeted human safety data in this context (das2022drugdiscoverystrategies pages 5-6, das2022drugdiscoverystrategies pages 16-17, ebeling2022testingmitochondrialtargeteddrugs pages 15-17).
