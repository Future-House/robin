Query: Pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and safety profiles of candidate small molecules or repurposed drugs shown to enhance RPE phagocytosis or autophagy in preclinical models of retinal degeneration, including ADME characteristics relevant to ocular delivery and blood–retinal barrier penetration

Candidate small molecules and repurposed drugs designed to enhance RPE phagocytosis or autophagy have been evaluated in preclinical models using a variety of ocular delivery routes, with pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and safety profiles highly dependent on the chosen method of administration. For instance, intravitreal injections typically bypass the blood–retinal barrier (BRB), allowing direct delivery of the drug to retinal tissues, whereas topical administration generally yields low intraocular bioavailability (<5%) in the aqueous humor, with extensive pre-corneal losses and increased systemic absorption (>50%) that may elevate systemic side‐effect risks (bahrpeyma2025bindingofocular pages 36-40).

The ADME properties of these candidate agents are strongly influenced by their physicochemical characteristics. Lipophilic, small molecules tend to permeate through the corneal route by passive diffusion, while hydrophilic or larger compounds may rely on the non-corneal conjunctiva-scleral route. However, the BRB is a formidable barrier for systemically administered drugs due to tight junctions and an abundance of efflux transporters such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs), which can reduce intracellular drug exposure by orders of magnitude (bahrpeyma2025bindingofocular pages 36-40, seethamraju2024obstructionandapproaches pages 5-7).

Preclinical studies indicate that intravitreal injection not only improves ocular drug levels but also minimizes systemic exposure, leading to sustained ocular pharmacokinetic profiles with dosing intervals ranging from monthly to several months. For example, mTOR inhibitors like rapamycin and sirolimus have been administered via either intravitreal or subconjunctival routes, demonstrating sustained drug presence in ocular tissues, acceptable tolerability, and minimal adverse effects (wang2022mtorsignallingpathway pages 16-17, fei2024challengesandopportunities pages 15-16). Similarly, sustained-release formulations such as the biodegradable implants used for AR-13503 have been shown to maintain therapeutic drug levels for up to six months, indicating that formulation design is critical for optimizing biodistribution (fei2024challengesandopportunities pages 15-16).

Active uptake transporters in the RPE may facilitate drug entry; however, their exact roles remain less well defined, compounding the challenge of ensuring sufficient intraocular concentrations to enhance autophagy or phagocytosis (bahrpeyma2025bindingofocular pages 36-40, seethamraju2024obstructionandapproaches pages 5-7). The clearance rates from the aqueous humor are generally rapid—ranging from 0.5 to 3 hours—with lipophilic compounds clearing more quickly than their hydrophilic or larger counterparts (bahrpeyma2025bindingofocular pages 36-40).

Safety profiles in preclinical models have been broadly favorable when drugs are delivered directly to the eye, as local administration tends to confine drug action to target tissues while minimizing systemic exposure. For orally administered agents such as APX3330 or metformin, which have established systemic safety profiles, there remains uncertainty regarding their ability to adequately cross the BRB and achieve therapeutic intraocular concentrations without causing off-target effects (fei2024challengesandopportunities pages 16-18, abokyi2021antioxidativeroleof pages 23-27).

In summary, while several candidate small molecules and repurposed drugs have demonstrated promising effects on RPE phagocytosis or autophagy in preclinical retinal degeneration models, their effectiveness hinges on optimizing absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion properties to overcome BRB constraints. More comprehensive quantitative ADME studies and detailed assessments of biodistribution combined with safety evaluations are needed to support clinical translation of these agents (das2022drugdiscoverystrategies pages 16-17, si2023theroleof pages 9-10).
