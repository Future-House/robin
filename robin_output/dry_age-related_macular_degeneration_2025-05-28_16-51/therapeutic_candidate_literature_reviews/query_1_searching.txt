Query: Searching for literature on high-throughput fluorescence-based RPE phagocytosis assays screening for novel small molecules that enhance photoreceptor outer segment clearance: focus on target validation through genetic and functional studies, efficacy in primary human RPE monolayers, mechanism confirmation, and safety evaluation in models

Fluorescence‐based high‐throughput assays have emerged as a promising platform to screen for novel small molecules capable of enhancing the clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) by retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells. This approach is built on the fundamental need to maintain retinal homeostasis, as efficient POS clearance is critical to prevent the accumulation of toxic by‐products that can lead to age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) and other degenerative conditions (egbejimi2022decipheringunderlyingmechanisms pages 26-32).

Many studies have leveraged flow cytometry‐ and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)–based approaches to quantify the dynamics of RPE phagocytosis. For instance, using FITC‐labeled POS and a robust flow cytometry workflow, researchers have quantified the bound and internalized fractions of fluorescent POS, while selectively removing adherent debris via post‐phagocytosis trypsinization and nuclear staining. This method not only allows for the assessment of internalization efficiency but also paves the way for high‐throughput screening of small molecules that modulate phagocytic receptor activity, such as αVβ5 integrin, CD36, and MerTK (westenskow2012usingflowcytometry pages 3-5, westenskow2012usingflowcytometry pages 2-3).

Complementary to these flow cytometry techniques, FRET–based assays have been developed to monitor the trafficking of internalized POS to lysosomes. One such assay uses FITC‐labeled POS fragments as a donor and Lysotracker as an acceptor, where a dose‐ and time‐dependent increase in FRET signal signifies successful fusion events between POS–containing phagosomes and lysosomes. This strategy offers the advantage of dissecting the uptake versus trafficking/degradation steps, which is crucial for understanding the molecular regulation of RPE phagocytosis. Functional validation in these systems has been achieved through pharmacological interventions – for example, chloroquine treatment inhibited lysosomal degradation by increasing the lysosomal pH and resulted in the expected elevation of FRET signal. Similarly, genetic perturbation by knocking down Atg5 provided further evidence of the assay’s ability to detect defective trafficking independent of uptake (egbejimi2022decipheringunderlyingmechanisms pages 36-41, egbejimi2022decipheringunderlyingmechanisms pages 18-21).

A key strength highlighted in the literature is the use of primary human RPE monolayers or iPSC‐derived RPE cells as more physiologically relevant models. Using such systems ensures that the outcomes of molecule screening can be more directly translated to human physiology. For example, studies have demonstrated that primary human RPE or iPSC‐derived RPE cells exhibit mature RPE characteristics—including robust phagocytosis of POS and proper barrier function—which are essential for evaluating the efficacy of candidate molecules in a disease-relevant context (brydon2019aavmediatedgeneaugmentation pages 6-10, lukovic2015humanipscderived pages 1-2).

Mechanism confirmation in these assays typically draws on both genetic and functional studies. Genetic modulation, whether by overexpression or knockdown of key phagocytic receptors or trafficking proteins, allows for the validation of molecular targets that small molecules are designed to affect. The fact that these assays can delineate the stages of phagocytosis—recognition, internalization, and degradation—facilitates a more granular dissection of the compounds’ mechanisms of action (mazzoni2014understandingphotoreceptorouter pages 1-2, campbell2018ahighcontent pages 1-2).

Safety evaluation remains a critical component. While initial screens in cell culture, including primary human RPE monolayers, provide insights into potential cytotoxicity, further evaluation in animal models (for instance, the RCS rat or other mammalian models) is essential to confirm that candidate compounds do not deleteriously affect retinal architecture or function. Preliminary reports from gene augmentation studies have observed effective rescue of phagocytic defects with minimal toxicity, underscoring that such assays can be integrated with safety assessments during preclinical development (brydon2019aavmediatedgeneaugmentation pages 10-13, sharma2021epithelialphenotyperestoring pages 13-14).

In summary, the literature supports the utility of high-throughput fluorescence-based assays—encompassing both flow cytometry and FRET methodologies—for screening small molecules that enhance RPE-mediated POS clearance. These assays incorporate genetic and functional target validation, efficacy testing in physiologically relevant primary human RPE models, elucidation of molecular mechanisms, and initial safety evaluations, thereby offering a robust framework for the development of novel therapeutics for retinal degenerative diseases (egbejimi2022decipheringunderlyingmechanisms pages 26-32, westenskow2012usingflowcytometry pages 3-5, brydon2019aavmediatedgeneaugmentation pages 6-10).
