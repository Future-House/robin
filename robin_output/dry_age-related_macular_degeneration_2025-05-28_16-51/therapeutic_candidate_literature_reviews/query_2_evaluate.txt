Query: Evaluate reports of high-throughput compound library screening protocols utilizing fluorescence-labeled photoreceptor outer segments and RPE cultures: identify hits with validated target engagement, subsequent efficacy in AMD animal models mimicking drusen accumulation, ADME characterization, and preliminary toxicology or human pharmacokinetic data

None of the reports in the provided context describe a high‐throughput compound screening protocol that integrates fluorescence‐labeled photoreceptor outer segments (POS) with RPE cultures and then follows the hits through a complete validation pipeline. In every case, either the screening assays do not incorporate fluorescence-labeled POS at all or the subsequent validation steps required for translational development—including target engagement confirmation, efficacy in AMD animal models with drusen-like features, ADME characterization, and preliminary toxicology or human pharmacokinetic data—are not reported.

Several studies used advanced phenotypic screening in RPE cultures such as iPSC-derived RPE (ebeling2022testingmitochondrialtargeteddrugs, sharma2021epithelialphenotyperestoring) or the ARPE-19 RPE model (schustak2024phenotypichighthroughputscreening). However, these studies explicitly note that while they performed high-throughput screens and in-depth cell death assays, there is no use of fluorescence-labeled POS incorporated into their screening protocols. For instance, the phenotypic screening protocol described by Schustak et al. focused on toxin-induced cell death using luminescence- and fluorescence-based readouts (via CytoTox-Glo and propidium iodide assays), but the authors clearly state that their protocol did not employ fluorescence-labeled photoreceptor outer segments (schustak2024phenotypichighthroughputscreening pages 11-13, schustak2024phenotypichighthroughputscreening pages 2-4).

Regarding target engagement and mechanism validation, one example is the identification of DF203 as a hit, which was validated to function as an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonist. This target engagement was confirmed by increased expression of CYP1A1 transcripts in response to treatment (schustak2024phenotypichighthroughputscreening pages 4-6). While this provides a mechanistic rationale for using AhR agonism to mitigate toxin-induced RPE cell death, the subsequent steps, such as testing the compound’s efficacy in AMD animal models that recapitulate drusen accumulation, were not undertaken or reported in these studies.

Furthermore, although some related studies (e.g., luu2024…pharmacologyapproach) discuss the importance of ADME and toxicology evaluation and even reference early clinical data—as in the case of PDE inhibitors tested for safety—the specific integration of such data with an HTS pipeline using fluorescence-labeled POS is absent. None of the sources reported subsequent comprehensive ADME profiling, preliminary toxicology, or human pharmacokinetic studies for the hits identified from the RPE-based screens (luu2024…pharmacologyapproach pages 101-106, marchesi2024differenttherapeuticapproaches pages 7-9).

In summary, while multiple studies have developed high-throughput screening approaches utilizing RPE cultures to discover compounds that protect against AMD-related cellular stress, there is no evidence in the provided context of any protocol that combines fluorescence-labeled photoreceptor outer segments with RPE cultures to identify hits which are then validated via target engagement, in vivo efficacy in AMD animal models mimicking drusen, or followed by comprehensive ADME and toxicology profiling (ebeling2022testingmitochondrialtargeteddrugs pages 1-2, schustak2024phenotypichighthroughputscreening pages 11-13, zhao2024retinalorganoidsa pages 2-4).
