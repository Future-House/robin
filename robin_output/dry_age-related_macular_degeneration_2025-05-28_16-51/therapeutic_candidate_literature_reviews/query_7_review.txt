Query: Review the role of oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and lipid peroxidation products in impairing RPE-mediated clearance of photoreceptor outer segments: focus on mechanistic confirmation in disease-relevant animal models, genetic knockout studies validating causative pathways, and potential molecular targets for drug intervention

Oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and lipid peroxidation products emerge as central mechanisms impairing the retinal pigment epithelium’s (RPE) ability to clear photoreceptor outer segments (POS), a function essential for photoreceptor health and overall retinal homeostasis. These interconnected stressors have been mechanistically confirmed in disease-relevant animal models and validated using genetic knockout studies, thereby highlighting several potential molecular targets for drug intervention.

Excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, a hallmark of oxidative stress, directly damages cellular components within RPE cells. ROS, generated from mitochondrial respiration, NADPH oxidases, and photosensitizer reactions, modify lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, ultimately impairing the RPE’s phagocytic machinery responsible for POS clearance. Experimental findings illustrate that oxidative stress-induced protein oxidation and lipid peroxidation critically disrupt receptor function and lysosomal degradation capacity in RPE cells, thereby instigating a harmful feed-forward loop that exacerbates oxidative damage (domenech2020therelevanceof pages 7-9, fanjulmoles2016relationshipbetweenoxidative pages 6-7).

Mitochondrial dysfunction is another pivotal factor contributing to defective RPE activity. Dysfunctional mitochondria, characterized by decreased ATP production, increased ROS generation, and disrupted dynamics (fusion/fission imbalance), result in inadequate energy supply and heightened cell stress. In animal models, mutations in mitochondrial genes such as OPA3 and IDH3A have been directly linked to early and severe photoreceptor degeneration. These genetically modified mice exhibit pronounced mitochondrial impairment that underlies defective RPE-mediated degradation of POS, thereby providing a causative link between mitochondrial dysfunction and retinal cell loss (collin2020mousemodelsof pages 25-27, tong2022roleofmitochondria pages 11-13).

Lipid peroxidation products, including detrimental compounds like A2E, further compromise the RPE’s clearance capacity. The accumulation of A2E and related lipid peroxidation by-products disrupts lysosomal membrane integrity and compromises the proton pump activity essential for POS degradation. This culminates in impaired autophagy and phagolysosomal maturation leading to RPE cell apoptosis. In animal studies, the accumulation of such peroxidation products has been associated with clinical features of retinal degenerative diseases, underscoring their role as a mechanistic link between oxidative injury and compromised RPE function (dejos2018photoreceptorinducedrpephagolysosomal pages 13-13, fanjulmoles2016relationshipbetweenoxidative pages 7-8).

Genetic knockout models further validate these pathways. For instance, specific knockout of genes involved in ROS detoxification, mitochondrial regulation, or phagocytosis (such as Mertk in mouse models of retinal degeneration) confirms that any disruption in these pathways directly correlates with impaired POS clearance and accelerated photoreceptor degeneration. In these systems, the genetic ablation of key regulators results in observable defects in lysosomal function, mitochondrial integrity, and, ultimately, RPE viability, thereby reinforcing the causative roles of oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage (collin2020mousemodelsof pages 25-27, lenin2023dysfunctionalautophagyproteostasis pages 2-4).

From a therapeutic perspective, multiple molecular targets have been identified to mitigate these damaging effects. Antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (Sod1, Sod2) represent attractive targets, as their upregulation could facilitate conversion of superoxide radicals to less harmful radicals. Moreover, molecules that can enhance mitochondrial biogenesis or stabilize mitochondrial membranes—such as humanin or resveratrol—have shown promise in preclinical studies by reducing ROS production and preserving mitochondrial function (tong2022roleofmitochondria pages 11-13). Agents that modulate autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis, such as modulators of mTOR signaling or chaperone proteins implicated in protein folding, present another intervention avenue, particularly in contexts where ER stress exacerbates RPE dysfunction (chen2023endoplasmicreticulumstress pages 18-19).

Collectively, these findings from disease-relevant animal models and genetic knockout studies not only provide mechanistic confirmation linking oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and lipid peroxidation to impaired RPE-mediated POS clearance but also identify promising molecular targets. Targeting these pathways may ultimately restore RPE function and halt the progression of retinal degenerative diseases (domenech2020therelevanceof pages 7-9, gallenga2021molecularmechanismsrelated pages 1-2).
