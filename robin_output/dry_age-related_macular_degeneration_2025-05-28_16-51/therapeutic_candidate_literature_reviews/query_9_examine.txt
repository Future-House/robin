Query: Examine genetic and epigenetic alterations in key phagocytosis-associated genes such as MERTK, RPE65, LRAT, and their impact on RPE outer segment clearance capacity in dry AMD: include patient cohort studies, functional rescue experiments, and downstream mechanistic pathway analysis

Genetic alterations in key phagocytosis-associated genes, particularly MERTK, have been widely documented in inherited retinal dystrophies, and these findings serve as a valuable proxy for understanding potential mechanisms in dry AMD. Studies have identified numerous pathogenic variants in MERTK – including splice‐site mutations, frameshift deletions, and nonsense mutations – that result in truncated proteins or trigger nonsense‐mediated decay. These alterations disrupt the normal apical localization of MERTK and impair the RPE’s capacity to recognize, internalize, and degrade photoreceptor outer segments (POS), leading to debris accumulation and secondary retinal degeneration (audo2018mertkmutationupdate pages 10-14). Patient cohort analyses have confirmed that such mutations correlate with significant functional impairment: for instance, imaging and electrophysiological studies on patients with MERTK mutations reveal reduced retinal sensitivity and characteristic fundus changes, underscoring the direct link between genetic defects and compromised POS clearance (ramsden2017rescueofthe pages 2-3).

The genetic data also underline that mutations in RPE65, a central enzyme in the visual cycle, may indirectly influence POS clearance. RPE65 is responsible for the conversion of all-trans retinol to 11-cis retinal, a step essential for both photoreceptor function and the removal of toxic visual cycle byproducts. Although patient cohort studies and detailed genetic analyses of RPE65 mutations in the context of dry AMD remain limited compared to MERTK, the consistent association of RPE65 dysfunction with retinal degenerations suggests that even subtle genetic alterations or altered expression levels could compromise the metabolic integrity of RPE cells and impede their phagocytic clearance capacity (si2023theroleof pages 9-10).

In contrast, direct genetic or omics evidence linking LRAT mutations to dry AMD is sparse. While LRAT’s role in the visual cycle is well established and mutations in LRAT are known to cause retinal dystrophies, its specific impact on phagocytosis within the RPE—and by extension in dry AMD—remains undercharacterized in current patient cohorts and genetic databases (OpenTargets Search: dry age-related macular degeneration-MERTK,RPE65,LRAT).

Functional rescue experiments provide additional insight into the mechanistic underpinnings of these genetic alterations. Patient-derived iPSC models of MERTK-deficient RPE have been instrumental for investigating rescue strategies through translational readthrough inducing drugs (TRIDs). In these studies, treatment with agents such as PTC124 (Ataluren) successfully restored detectable MERTK expression and partially recovered phagocytic activity, while alternative agents like G418 revealed limitations owing to toxicity or lack of full functionality (ramsden2017rescueofthe pages 2-3). These experiments not only validate the causative link between MERTK deficiency and defective POS clearance but also demonstrate the potential for pharmacological intervention in genetically driven phagocytic dysfunction.

Downstream mechanistic studies have further elucidated how impaired phagocytosis translates into retinal pathology. Defective MERTK signaling leads to reduced clearance of outer segment debris, which in turn drives a pro-inflammatory milieu in the retina characterized by upregulation of cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6, as well as microglial activation. Some investigations in murine models have highlighted that the loss of MERTK—and, in combination with related signaling receptors like TYRO3—exacerbates RPE inflammation, thereby accelerating photoreceptor degeneration (ghosh2024intheeyes pages 8-9, ramsden2017usingstemcells pages 209-216). This cascade underscores the balance between a functional phagocytic machinery and the maintenance of anti-inflammatory signaling; disruption at the genetic level can thus initiate a vicious cycle of debris accumulation and chronic inflammation.

In summary, patient cohort studies, functional rescue approaches, and mechanistic pathway analyses converge on the conclusion that genetic alterations in MERTK—and to a lesser extent RPE65 and LRAT—can critically impair the RPE’s capacity to clear photoreceptor outer segments, thereby contributing to the progression of dry AMD. Further research, particularly integrating comprehensive genetic screening with targeted therapeutic interventions, is warranted to fully delineate the pathogenic role of these genes in dry AMD (audo2018mertkmutationupdate pages 17-19, ramsden2017rescueofthe pages 1-2).
