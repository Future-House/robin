Query: Compile preclinical and clinical evidence of emerging drug candidates aimed at improving RPE lysosomal function and autophagy to boost outer segment clearance: include high-content fluorescence-based phagocytosis assay outcomes, mechanistic target validation, efficacy in patient-derived iPSC-RPE models, and pharmacology/toxicology reports

The current evidence base for emerging drug candidates to improve retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) lysosomal function and autophagy for enhanced outer segment clearance is exclusively preclinical. No clinical trials have yet been registered for therapies targeting this axis (Clinical Trials Search: RPE lysosomal autophagy drug).

Preclinical studies using stem cell‐derived RPE models have robustly demonstrated that dysregulated lysosomal activity and autophagy underlie the accumulation of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) and toxic lipofuscin-like deposits. These studies have established high-content fluorescence-based phagocytosis assays as a primary endpoint to quantify POS clearance. For example, stem cell-derived RPE models have been used to track the accumulation of unprocessed rhodopsin and autofluorescent material, providing reliable readouts for lysosomal degradation capacity (cardoso2018stemcellderivedretinal pages 159-162). Moreover, these assays facilitate the evaluation of drug efficacy under conditions of experimentally induced lysosomal dysfunction with agents such as chloroquine (cardoso2018stemcellderivedretinal pages 164-167).

Mechanistic target validation has largely focused on the mTORC1/TFEB axis. Abnormal mTOR activity in aged or stressed RPE cells suppresses TFEB nuclear translocation, thereby reducing lysosomal biogenesis and autophagic flux. Preclinical data demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of mTOR using rapamycin not only reduced POS-dependent autofluorescence by approximately 30% but also promoted TFEB translocation and upregulated lysosomal markers like LAMP1 (falcao2024enhancinglysosomefunction pages 10-13). In these studies, drug candidates such as INK-128 and a compound referred to as Drug H recapitulated rapamycin’s effects, further confirming mTOR as a central target. Additionally, genetic approaches employing adeno-associated virus-mediated overexpression of constitutively active TFEB reinforced the notion that vigorous activation of TFEB can enhance lysosomal clearance (falcao2024enhancinglysosomefunction pages 13-18, 26-29).

Patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-RPE models have been instrumental in recapitulating disease phenotypes seen in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and other retinal degenerative diseases. Studies using iPSC-RPE cells have validated key features such as impaired phagocytosis, lysosomal lipid accumulation, and extracellular deposit formation. These models allow for high-content fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry analyses to quantify the accumulation of autofluorescent granules and remaining POS, thereby serving as robust assays for drug screening (cardoso2018stemcellderivedretinal pages 179-182, ramsden2017usingstemcells pages 221-227). Additionally, patient-derived models have highlighted the variable response rates among different patient genotypes, providing a baseline for personalized therapeutic evaluation (ebeling2022testingmitochondrialtargeteddrugs pages 2-4, 9-11).

Pharmacological interventions beyond mTOR inhibition have also been explored. Agents such as the AMPK activators AICAR and metformin have been shown to positively modulate mitochondrial function while indirectly enhancing autophagy in patient-derived iPSC-RPE models. These compounds improved basal mitochondrial respiration, underscoring the interplay between energy metabolism and lysosomal function (ebeling2022testingmitochondrialtargeteddrugs pages 2-4). In contrast, trehalose, a naturally occurring autophagy inducer, showed promising mechanistic actions through TFEB activation; however, prolonged exposure in some iPSC-RPE lines proved cytotoxic, illustrating the delicate balance required in optimizing dosing regimens (ebeling2022testingmitochondrialtargeteddrugs pages 9-11).

High-content fluorescence-based assays have been critical throughout these evaluations, offering quantitative measures of drug efficacy by tracking shifts in key biomarkers such as LC3 conversion, rhodopsin internalization, and autofluorescent granule formation. These assays have not only enabled mechanistic target validation in controlled preclinical settings but have also provided the necessary throughput for screening multiple candidate drugs in parallel (cardoso2018stemcellderivedretinal pages 159-162, yang2021functionsanddiseases pages 4-5).

Pharmacology and toxicology assessments remain in the early stages. Although rapamycin and its analogs have demonstrated robust activity in preclinical models, their clinical use is limited by known side effects. Likewise, while metformin has pre-established safety data from its use in other indications, emerging data in iPSC-RPE models highlight the need for further optimization to minimize off-target effects. These preclinical studies underscore the importance of developing drug delivery systems—such as synthetic high-density lipoprotein nanoparticles—to mitigate systemic toxicity and improve RPE targeting (falcao2024enhancinglysosomefunction pages 13-18).

In summary, the evidence from preclinical research supports a multifaceted therapeutic approach to enhance RPE lysosomal function and autophagy. Emerging drug candidates, including mTOR inhibitors (rapamycin, INK-128), TFEB activators, AMPK modulators (AICAR, metformin), and autophagy inducers like trehalose, have been validated through high-content fluorescence-based phagocytosis assays, mechanistic studies, and efficacy testing in patient-derived iPSC-RPE models. Although pharmacology and toxicology data are still being refined and no clinical trials have been registered to date, the robust preclinical framework provides strong rationale for further clinical translation (cardoso2018stemcellderivedretinal pages 164-167, falcao2024enhancinglysosomefunction pages 26-29, ebeling2022testingmitochondrialtargeteddrugs pages 2-4).
