Query: Investigations of molecular targets and signaling pathways regulating RPE phagocytosis in health and dry AMD contexts, including MerTK, MFGE8, αvβ5 integrin receptors, and their upstream regulators, with genetic and pharmacological validation of pathway modulation improving outer segment clearance in RPE cells

The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is responsible for phagocytosing shed photoreceptor outer segments (POS), a process critical for maintaining retinal homeostasis and preventing debris accumulation that characterizes dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) (albert2015triamcinoloneregulatedapoptophagocytic pages 12-12). Central to this process is the receptor tyrosine kinase MerTK, which orchestrates the internalization phase of phagocytosis by receiving signals from bridging ligands such as Gas6 and Protein S and triggering downstream signaling cascades essential for cytoskeletal rearrangements (moran2022regulationofthe pages 9-11). Genetic models, including MerTK knockout animals such as the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rat, demonstrate that loss‐of‐function mutations in MerTK cause defective clearance of POS, leading to photoreceptor degeneration, thereby providing genetic validation for MerTK’s critical role (albert2015triamcinoloneregulatedapoptophagocytic pages 11-12, moran2022regulationofthe pages 16-18).

Complementing MerTK, the integrin heterodimer αvβ5 plays a pivotal role in the recognition and binding phase of the phagocytic process. αvβ5 integrin is localized to the apical surface of RPE cells where it interacts with the secreted bridging molecule milk fat globule-epidermal growth factor 8 (MFGE8) to facilitate the binding of POS via recognition of externalized phosphatidylserine (lieffrig2023clearancephagocytosisby pages 9-11). MFGE8, serving as an indispensable ligand for αvβ5 integrin, not only promotes binding but also ensures the initiation of subsequent internalization signals which are critical for maintaining the diurnal phagocytic burst (baileysteinitz2021developmentofin pages 99-102, lieffrig2023clearancephagocytosisby pages 11-12).

Upstream of these receptor-ligand interactions, several intracellular signaling regulators fine-tune the phagocytotic process. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is activated upon engagement of αvβ5 integrin by MFGE8, transmitting signals that culminate in downstream activation of MerTK (lieffrig2023clearancephagocytosisby pages 12-14). Additionally, small GTPases, notably Rac1, are recruited to regulate actin cytoskeletal reorganization, forming the phagocytic cup necessary for engulfment (lieffrig2023clearancephagocytosisby pages 35-37). Pharmacological inhibition studies that target RhoA/ROCK signaling further demonstrate that suppression of this pathway enhances actin dynamics and improved phagocytic cup formation, implying that a balance between Rac1 activation and RhoA/ROCK inhibition is critical for efficient POS clearance (lieffrig2023clearancephagocytosisby pages 35-37, nita2023antioxidativeroleof pages 23-25).

Multiple signaling pathways have been implicated in modulating these events. Quantitative phosphoproteomic analyses have underscored the involvement of the PI3K/Akt, mTOR, and MEK/ERK pathways in early phagocytic events, with specific phosphorylation events altering cytoskeletal and membrane remodeling (chiang2017quantitativephosphoproteomicsreveals pages 8-9, chiang2017quantitativephosphoproteomicsreveals pages 17-18). These pathways integrate inputs from both MerTK activation and integrin engagement, coordinating a swift cellular response to phagocytose POS in a highly regulated and timely manner.

Pharmacological interventions, such as treatment with triamcinolone, have been shown to enhance phagocytosis by modulating the expression of apopto-phagocytic genes and by potentiating MerTK signaling (albert2015triamcinoloneregulatedapoptophagocytic pages 11-12). Although genetic data from repositories such as Open Targets provide limited direct associations between these targets and dry AMD, the extensive mechanistic studies presented in these investigations validate the modulation of MerTK, MFGE8, and αvβ5 integrin pathways as effective strategies to boost outer segment clearance by RPE cells in both healthy and diseased states (OpenTargets Search: dry age-related macular degeneration-MerTK,MFGE8,ITGAV,ITGB5, chiang2017quantitativephosphoproteomicsreveals pages 1-2).

In summary, the intricate interplay between MerTK, MFGE8, and αvβ5 integrin, along with their upstream regulators such as FAK, Rac1, and key kinase signaling pathways, underpins efficient RPE phagocytosis. Both genetic knockout models and pharmacological modulation provide compelling evidence that enhancing these pathways represents a promising therapeutic avenue for improving outer segment clearance, potentially ameliorating the progression of dry AMD (albert2015triamcinoloneregulatedapoptophagocytic pages 12-12, lieffrig2023clearancephagocytosisby pages 1-3).
