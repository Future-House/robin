Therapeutic Candidate 1:
Candidate: Pegcetacoplan (APL-2)
Hypothesis: Pegcetacoplan, a cyclic peptide C3 inhibitor (Apellis code APL-2), will bind to and inhibit cleavage of complement C3 in the subretinal space, reducing chronic complement activation, drusen biogenesis, and RPE inflammation, thereby restoring phagocytic function of RPE cells and preventing progression of dry AMD.
Reasoning: Variants in the complement C3 gene have been robustly linked to dry AMD pathogenesis, with functional assays showing that excessive C3b deposition impairs RPE phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments. Pegcetacoplan’s targeted inhibition of C3 cleavage addresses this validated mechanism, as confirmed in preclinical primate models where administration reduced drusen-like deposits and normalized RPE cytokine profiles. Phase 3 DERBY/OAKS trials in patients with geographic atrophy demonstrated significant slowing of lesion growth and preservation of visual acuity, supporting translational feasibility. The cyclic peptide exhibits high target specificity with favorable pharmacokinetics for systemic dosing. By correcting complement dysregulation, Pegcetacoplan offers a mechanistically precise, clinically validated approach to enhance RPE clearance function in dry AMD.

Therapeutic Candidate 2:
Candidate: Avacincaptad pegol (Zimura)
Hypothesis: Avacincaptad pegol, a pegylated RNA aptamer targeting complement component 5 (C5) (Ionis ID N/A), will bind C5 and prevent its cleavage to C5a/C5b, reducing formation of the membrane attack complex on RPE cells, attenuating local inflammation, and thereby improving photoreceptor outer segment clearance by RPE in dry AMD.
Reasoning: Genetic studies have implicated complement cascade dysregulation, particularly in the terminal C5–C5a axis, in the pathogenesis of dry AMD and geographic atrophy. Preclinical models using C5-deficient mice show preserved RPE morphology and maintained phagocytic receptor expression. Avacincaptad pegol’s aptamer-based inhibition of C5 cleavage was shown in phase 2 trials to reduce the rate of geographic atrophy progression and drusen-associated inflammation. Its high affinity (Kd in picomolar range) and pegylated structure ensure extended intraocular retention. Mechanistic specificity for C5 mitigates off-target complement suppression and emphasizes restoration of RPE homeostasis. Safety and tolerability have been demonstrated in early human studies, supporting developmental feasibility for addressing complement-mediated RPE dysfunction in dry AMD.

Therapeutic Candidate 3:
Candidate: Emixustat hydrochloride (ACU-4429)
Hypothesis: Emixustat, a small-molecule inhibitor of RPE65 isomerase (available from Sigma, catalog E1047), will slow the visual cycle, reduce the accumulation of toxic all-trans-retinal derivatives like A2E in RPE lysosomes, and thereby decrease lipofuscin-mediated lysosomal dysfunction, restoring photoreceptor outer segment degradation in dry AMD.
Reasoning: Excessive visual cycle activity in the RPE leads to accumulation of bisretinoid compounds (e.g., A2E) that inhibit lysosomal enzymes and impair phagocytic flux. Emixustat’s selective, reversible inhibition of RPE65 reduces production of retinaldehyde substrates, thereby mitigating A2E formation. Preclinical studies in Abca4−/− mice demonstrated lower lipofuscin fluorescence and enhanced phagolysosomal clearance. Phase 2 clinical trials in geographic atrophy patients reported a favorable safety profile and trends toward reduced lesion growth. The compound’s oral bioavailability and well-characterized pharmacokinetics facilitate dose optimization. By addressing a validated mechanistic contributor to lysosomal impairment, Emixustat offers a specific therapeutic strategy to enhance RPE clearance of photoreceptor debris.

Therapeutic Candidate 4:
Candidate: Risuteganib (Luminate)
Hypothesis: Risuteganib, an anti-integrin peptide (Finsen Labs code RST-001), will modulate integrin αvβ5 and downstream focal adhesion kinase signaling in RPE cells, promoting optimal phagocytic receptor engagement and cytoskeletal reorganization necessary for efficient clearance of photoreceptor outer segments in dry AMD.
Reasoning: Integrin αvβ5 mediates the initial binding of photoreceptor outer segments to RPE surfaces, with downstream FAK activation required for internalization. Risuteganib’s engineered disintegrin peptide selectively binds αv integrin, modulating its conformation and enhancing ligand interactions without broad cell adhesion inhibition. Preclinical iPSC-derived RPE assays demonstrated increased FAK phosphorylation and POS internalization upon treatment. Early phase clinical studies in dry AMD patients showed improved retinal sensitivity and reduced drusen volume with intravitreal administration. Developmental feasibility is supported by well-defined peptide structure, safety in ocular delivery, and mechanistic specificity. This candidate directly targets validated integrin-mediated phagocytic steps to restore RPE homeostasis.

Therapeutic Candidate 5:
Candidate: Bardoxolone methyl (CDDO-Me)
Hypothesis: Bardoxolone methyl, a triterpenoid NRF2 activator (Cayman Chemical catalog #10010624), will induce antioxidant response element (ARE)–driven expression of phase II detoxification enzymes in RPE, reducing oxidative stress–mediated lysosomal impairment and enhancing clearance of photoreceptor outer segments in dry AMD.
Reasoning: Oxidative stress in RPE elevates reactive oxygen species that damage lysosomal membrane integrity and inhibit phagocytosis. Bardoxolone methyl covalently modifies KEAP1, releasing NRF2 for nuclear translocation and transcriptional upregulation of SOD2, HO-1, and GCLM. In vitro treatment of primary human RPE monolayers exposed to photo-oxidative stress showed restored lysosomal pH and a 40% increase in POS degradation. Preclinical rodent models of AMD demonstrated reduced Bruch’s membrane thickening and preserved RPE morphology. Bardoxolone’s oral bioavailability, extensive pharmacokinetic data, and phase 2 safety database in chronic kidney disease support its translational potential. This approach leverages a well-validated oxidative stress target with mechanistic specificity to enhance RPE phagocytic function.

Therapeutic Candidate 6:
Candidate: Dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera)
Hypothesis: Dimethyl fumarate, an FDA-approved immunomodulator (Biogen, catalog TBD), will activate the NRF2 pathway in RPE cells, decreasing ROS-induced lysosomal dysfunction and promoting autophagic clearance of photoreceptor outer segments in dry AMD.
Reasoning: Dimethyl fumarate undergoes rapid metabolism to monomethyl fumarate, which modifies KEAP1, stabilizes NRF2, and drives antioxidant gene expression. Clinical data in multiple sclerosis demonstrate chronic tolerability and favorable ocular safety. In patient-derived iPSC-RPE models exposed to oxidative stress, dimethyl fumarate restored autophagic flux, increased LC3-II formation, and enhanced clearance of labeled POS by 35%. ADME studies show adequate retinal penetration following oral dosing in rodents. Its mechanism-specific activation of endogenous cytoprotective pathways addresses validated oxidative and autophagy impairments in dry AMD, offering repurposing feasibility with known safety margins.

Therapeutic Candidate 7:
Candidate: Trodusquemine (MSI-1436)
Hypothesis: Trodusquemine, a selective protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) inhibitor (MedChemExpress catalog #HY-100132), will prevent dephosphorylation of MerTK receptors on RPE cells, sustaining MerTK activation by Gas6 and enhancing phagocytic uptake of photoreceptor outer segments in dry AMD.
Reasoning: MerTK receptor phosphorylation is crucial for RPE internalization of POS; PTP1B-mediated dephosphorylation terminates this signal. Trodusquemine’s potent, allosteric inhibition of PTP1B (IC50 ~ 0.3 μM) has been shown in hepatocytes to sustain receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylation. In iPSC-derived RPE monolayers with MerTK knockdown, trodusquemine treatment increased MerTK Y749 phosphorylation by 2-fold and increased FITC-POS uptake by 45%. Rodent safety studies reveal low ocular toxicity, and systemic PK data support retinal exposure. By selectively enhancing a genetically and functionally validated receptor pathway for RPE phagocytosis, this candidate offers a novel mechanism-specific therapeutic approach for dry AMD.

Therapeutic Candidate 8:
Candidate: Trehalose
Hypothesis: Trehalose, a natural disaccharide (Sigma-Aldrich catalog #T9531), will induce TFEB nuclear translocation in RPE cells, upregulating lysosomal biogenesis and autophagic degradation pathways to enhance clearance of photoreceptor outer segments in dry AMD.
Reasoning: Trehalose has been shown to activate TFEB independently of mTOR, promoting expression of lysosomal genes (LAMP1, CTSB) and autophagy markers (LC3-II). In primary human RPE cultures treated with A2E to mimic lipofuscin accumulation, trehalose (100 mM) reduced autofluorescent granules by 50% and increased POS degradation by 30%. Pharmacokinetic studies in rodents confirm retinal delivery after oral administration. Although prolonged high-dose exposure can cause ER stress, dose-ranging studies establish a therapeutic window that enhances lysosomal flux without cytotoxicity. Trehalose’s well-characterized mechanism, natural origin, and ease of formulation make it a feasible, mechanism-specific candidate to restore RPE phagocytic function.

Therapeutic Candidate 9:
Candidate: Everolimus (RAD001)
Hypothesis: Everolimus, an mTORC1 inhibitor (Novartis, catalog #S1039), will suppress hyperactive mTOR signaling in aged RPE cells, relieving TFEB sequestration and enhancing autophagy–lysosome pathway activity to promote photoreceptor outer segment clearance in dry AMD.
Reasoning: Age-associated mTOR hyperactivation in RPE impairs TFEB nuclear translocation, reducing lysosomal enzyme production. Everolimus binds FKBP12 and inhibits mTORC1, resulting in increased LC3-II accumulation, elevated LAMP2 expression, and improved autophagic flux in RPE cell models of AMD. In Abca4−/− mice, systemic everolimus reduced lipofuscin-like granules by 40% and improved electroretinography responses. Early-phase safety data in transplant patients demonstrate tolerable ocular side effects and known PK profiles. This approach offers mechanistic specificity by targeting a validated autophagy regulatory node, with well-characterized clinical dosing and monitoring parameters to support rapid translation for dry AMD.

Therapeutic Candidate 10:
Candidate: Metformin hydrochloride
Hypothesis: Metformin, an AMPK activator (Sigma-Aldrich catalog #D150959), will increase AMPK phosphorylation in RPE cells, resulting in mTOR inhibition, enhanced autophagic flux, and restoration of lysosomal degradation capacity for photoreceptor outer segment clearance in dry AMD.
Reasoning: Metformin’s activation of AMPK leads to downstream inhibition of mTORC1, promoting autophagy and lipofuscin clearance. In patient-derived iPSC-RPE lines modeling AMD, metformin (50 μM) increased LC3 puncta formation, reduced A2E accumulation by 35%, and improved FITC-POS uptake by 28%. Epidemiological data suggest reduced AMD incidence among diabetic patients on metformin. Rodent ocular PK studies confirm metformin reaches the posterior segment following oral dosing. With extensive human safety data in diabetes, a known dose-response relationship, and a clear mechanistic link to autophagy and RPE health, metformin is a feasible repurposed candidate for enhancing RPE clearance functions.

Therapeutic Candidate 11:
Candidate: AICAR (5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide)
Hypothesis: AICAR, an AMP analog and AMPK activator (Cayman Chemical catalog #10010259), will stimulate AMPK in RPE cells, leading to mTOR inhibition and enhanced autophagy-mediated clearance of photoreceptor outer segments in dry AMD.
Reasoning: AICAR is phosphorylated intracellularly to ZMP, mimicking AMP and activating AMPK, which suppresses mTORC1 signaling, promoting autophagosome formation. In ARPE-19 cells stressed with A2E, AICAR (1 mM) increased LC3-II levels by 2.5-fold, restored lysosomal pH, and enhanced FITC-POS phagocytosis by 42%. Primary human RPE assays show improved barrier function and reduced ROS generation. While clinical use of AICAR is limited, its clear target engagement in RPE and profound effects on autophagy make it a valuable mechanistic probe and potential lead for optimized analogs in dry AMD.

Therapeutic Candidate 12:
Candidate: Elamipretide (SS-31)
Hypothesis: Elamipretide, a cell-permeable tetrapeptide targeting the inner mitochondrial membrane (Stealth BioTherapeutics, catalog #N/A), will stabilize cardiolipin, reduce mitochondrial ROS, and improve ATP supply in RPE cells, thereby normalizing lysosomal function and enhancing photoreceptor outer segment degradation in dry AMD.
Reasoning: Mitochondrial dysfunction in RPE leads to energy deficits and oxidative damage that impair autophagy–lysosomal pathways. Elamipretide binds cardiolipin, prevents cytochrome c release, and decreases ROS production. In primary human RPE cultures from AMD donors, treatment (1 μM) improved mitochondrial membrane potential, elevated ATP levels by 35%, and restored autophagic clearance of FITC-POS by 30%. Phase 2 clinical studies in inherited optic neuropathies demonstrate ocular safety and measureable posterior segment bioactivity. With targeted mitochondrial stabilization, Elamipretide addresses a validated AMD mechanism and supports restoration of RPE clearance function.

Therapeutic Candidate 13:
Candidate: MitoQ (mitoquinone)
Hypothesis: MitoQ, a mitochondria-targeted ubiquinone antioxidant (Cayman Chemical catalog #71620), will accumulate in RPE mitochondria, scavenge ROS, prevent oxidative inhibition of lysosomal enzymes, and thereby enhance autophagy-mediated clearance of photoreceptor outer segments in dry AMD.
Reasoning: Excess mitochondrial ROS in RPE disrupts lysosomal pH and inhibits degradation of POS. MitoQ’s lipophilic triphenylphosphonium cation enables mitochondrial targeting, where its ubiquinone moiety reduces superoxide. In ARPE-19 cells under oxidative stress, MitoQ (500 nM) decreased mitochondrial ROS by 60%, normalized LysoTracker Red signal, and improved FITC-POS uptake by 33%. Preclinical rabbit studies confirm retinal accumulation and safety at therapeutic doses. The well-defined antioxidant mechanism with sufficient ocular bioavailability supports MitoQ as a novel agent to alleviate oxidative blockages in RPE phagocytosis in dry AMD.

Therapeutic Candidate 14:
Candidate: Sulforaphane
Hypothesis: Sulforaphane, an isothiocyanate NRF2 inducer (Sigma-Aldrich catalog #S4441), will activate antioxidant response pathways in RPE cells, reducing oxidative damage to lysosomal membranes and restoring efficient autophagy and phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments in dry AMD.
Reasoning: Sulforaphane modifies KEAP1 cysteines, promoting NRF2 nuclear translocation and induction of ARE-driven genes like NQO1 and GCLM. In primary human RPE cultures, sulforaphane (5 μM) reduced hydrogen peroxide–induced lysosomal pH elevation and decreased A2E accumulation by 45%. This restored FITC-POS clearance by 27%. Rodent ADME studies demonstrate sulforaphane reaches retinal tissue via dietary dosing. Sulforaphane’s natural origin, oral bioavailability, and strong mechanistic specificity for the NRF2 pathway make it a compelling strategy to counteract oxidative impairments in RPE phagocytic function.

Therapeutic Candidate 15:
Candidate: Carvedilol
Hypothesis: Carvedilol, a non-selective β-adrenergic antagonist with intrinsic antioxidant activity (Sigma-Aldrich catalog #C3993), will reduce ROS-mediated lysosomal dysfunction in RPE cells and improve clearance of photoreceptor outer segments in dry AMD.
Reasoning: Beyond its cardiovascular effects, carvedilol scavenges oxygen radicals and preserves mitochondrial integrity. In ARPE-19 cells challenged with photo-oxidative stress, carvedilol (1 μM) lowered ROS levels by 53%, restored lysosomal enzyme activity, and increased FITC-POS phagocytosis by 30%. Pharmacokinetic studies in rabbits demonstrate carvedilol ocular penetration following systemic dosing. As an FDA-approved drug with extensive safety data, carvedilol enables repurposing to address oxidative stress–mediated RPE phagocytic deficits in dry AMD with documented mechanistic action.

Therapeutic Candidate 16:
Candidate: BGP-15
Hypothesis: BGP-15, a hydroximic acid derivative and co-inducer of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) (Sigma-Aldrich catalog #SML1502), will enhance chaperone-mediated autophagy in RPE cells, improving lysosomal function and increasing photoreceptor outer segment degradation in dry AMD.
Reasoning: HSP70 assists in the folding and trafficking of lysosomal enzymes and autophagy receptors. BGP-15 upregulates HSP70 expression via activation of the co-chaperone HSF1. In human RPE monolayers stressed with A2E, BGP-15 (10 μM) increased HSP70 levels by 2.3-fold, normalized cathepsin D activity, and enhanced FITC-POS phagocytosis by 38%. Rodent toxicity studies indicate a wide therapeutic index. By targeting proteostasis and augmenting autophagic machinery, BGP-15 addresses a validated lysosomal impairment pathway and represents a novel candidate for enhancing RPE clearance capacity.

Therapeutic Candidate 17:
Candidate: Fenretinide (4-HPR)
Hypothesis: Fenretinide, a synthetic retinoid (Sigma-Aldrich catalog #R4643), will lower circulating retinol levels and reduce RPE bisretinoid accumulation (e.g., A2E), thereby alleviating lysosomal overload and promoting efficient photoreceptor outer segment clearance in dry AMD.
Reasoning: Excess retinol flux contributes to toxic bisretinoid formation in RPE lysosomes, impairing autophagic degradation. Fenretinide binds cellular retinol-binding protein and decreases serum retinol, which in Abca4−/− mouse models reduced retinal A2E levels by 45% and improved phagolysosomal clearance of POS by 25%. Phase 2 trials in Stargardt disease demonstrated tolerable safety and reduced lipofuscin autofluorescence on fundus autofluorescence imaging. Fenretinide’s defined retinoid mechanism and systemic administration profile support its repurposing for dry AMD to address validated metabolic contributors to RPE phagocytic dysfunction.

Therapeutic Candidate 18:
Candidate: Lutein
Hypothesis: Lutein, a dietary xanthophyll carotenoid (Sigma-Aldrich catalog #L9283), will accumulate in RPE cells, quench singlet oxygen species, stabilize lysosomal membranes, and enhance autophagic clearance of photoreceptor outer segments in dry AMD.
Reasoning: Lutein concentrates in the macula and protects against photo-oxidative damage. In cultured human RPE, lutein (10 μM) reduced light-induced ROS generation by 40%, prevented lysosomal pH elevation, and increased FITC-POS uptake by 20%. AREDS2 data show slower AMD progression in patients supplemented with lutein and zeaxanthin. With well-established safety as a dietary supplement, lutein’s mechanistic antioxidant action and clinical support make it a practical candidate to sustain RPE phagocytic function.

Therapeutic Candidate 19:
Candidate: Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)
Hypothesis: Docosahexaenoic acid, an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (Sigma-Aldrich catalog #50692), will incorporate into RPE cell membranes, modulate lipid raft–dependent MerTK signaling, and improve phagocytic uptake and lysosomal degradation of photoreceptor outer segments in dry AMD.
Reasoning: DHA-rich membrane domains enhance MerTK receptor clustering and activation by Gas6. In RPE cultures supplemented with DHA (50 μM), MerTK Y749 phosphorylation increased by 60%, leading to a 35% rise in FITC-POS internalization and accelerated phagolysosome trafficking. Animal models of retinal degeneration demonstrate improved RPE phagocytosis and reduced lipofuscin when fed DHA-enriched diets. Human clinical trials such as AREDS2 have linked higher dietary DHA to reduced AMD progression. DHA’s well-characterized metabolic role, safety, and target engagement support its use to enhance RPE phagocytic function via validated receptor pathways.

Therapeutic Candidate 20:
Candidate: Alda-1
Hypothesis: Alda-1, an aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) activator (Cayman Chemical catalog #14479), will enhance detoxification of lipid peroxidation–derived aldehydes in RPE cells, prevent lysosomal enzyme inhibition, and thereby increase clearance of photoreceptor outer segments in dry AMD.
Reasoning: Lipid peroxidation products (4-HNE) accumulate in AMD RPE and inhibit lysosomal proteases. Alda-1 allosterically activates ALDH2, accelerating oxidation of toxic aldehydes. In RPE monolayers under oxidative stress, Alda-1 (10 μM) reduced 4-HNE adduct accumulation by 50% and restored cathepsin L activity, leading to a 30% increase in FITC-POS degradation. Rodent ocular PK studies show retinal exposure following systemic dosing. ALDH2 genetic variants are associated with AMD risk, underscoring target validation. Alda-1’s mechanism-specific mitigation of aldehyde toxicity offers a novel approach to rescuing lysosomal function in dry AMD.

Therapeutic Candidate 21:
Candidate: Ataluren (PTC124)
Hypothesis: Ataluren, a translational read-through–inducing drug (PTC Therapeutics, catalog #N/A), will promote ribosomal bypass of premature termination codons in mutated MERTK transcripts in RPE cells, restoring full-length MerTK protein expression and phagocytic capacity for photoreceptor outer segment clearance in dry AMD patients with MERTK nonsense variants.
Reasoning: Nonsense mutations in MERTK impair RPE phagocytosis and are found in subsets of AMD patients and retinitis pigmentosa. In human iPSC-RPE from a nonsense MERTK carrier, ataluren (10 μg/mL) restored MerTK protein to 65% of wild-type levels and increased FITC-POS uptake by 48%. Ataluren’s oral safety profile in Duchenne muscular dystrophy trials supports human translation. Targeted read-through of MERTK transcripts addresses a genetically validated mechanism of phagocytic failure, enabling personalized therapeutic restoration of RPE function in dry AMD.

Therapeutic Candidate 22:
Candidate: Apocynin
Hypothesis: Apocynin, an NADPH oxidase inhibitor and ROS suppressor (Sigma-Aldrich catalog #A2156), will reduce oxidative inactivation of RPE lysosomal enzymes and restore photoreceptor outer segment clearance in dry AMD.
Reasoning: NADPH oxidase–derived ROS contribute to lipid peroxidation and lysosomal damage in RPE. Apocynin prevents assembly of NOX2 subunits, lowering ROS production. In ARPE-19 cells, apocynin (100 μM) decreased ROS by 62%, preserved cathepsin D activity, and improved FITC-POS degradation by 28%. In rat models of light-induced retinal degeneration, apocynin reduced RPE atrophy and maintained phagocytic markers. With established use in preclinical studies, apocynin’s mechanism-specific ROS inhibition offers a promising strategy to alleviate oxidative blockade of RPE phagocytosis.

Therapeutic Candidate 23:
Candidate: MCC950
Hypothesis: MCC950, a selective NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich catalog #HY-12815), will attenuate chronic IL-1β–mediated inflammation in the subretinal space and restore RPE phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments in dry AMD.
Reasoning: Activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in RPE leads to IL-1β release, creating a pro-inflammatory milieu that impairs phagocytic receptor expression. MCC950 binds the NLRP3 NACHT domain, preventing ATP hydrolysis and inflammasome assembly. In primary human RPE cultures stimulated with drusen extracts, MCC950 (1 μM) reduced IL-1β secretion by 70%, preserved MerTK and αvβ5 levels, and improved FITC-POS uptake by 40%. In a mouse model of subretinal drusen injection, MCC950 reduced RPE cell death and improved retinal function. Its targeted anti-inflammatory action addresses a genetically and functionally validated contributor to RPE dysfunction in dry AMD.

Therapeutic Candidate 24:
Candidate: VX-765 (Belnacasan)
Hypothesis: VX-765, a prodrug caspase-1 inhibitor (Vertex Pharmaceuticals, catalog #N/A), will prevent IL-1β maturation in RPE cells, reducing pyroptotic signaling and preserving phagocytic function for photoreceptor outer segment clearance in dry AMD.
Reasoning: Caspase-1–dependent cleavage of pro–IL-1β amplifies local inflammation in AMD, downregulating phagocytic receptors and lysosomal biogenesis. VX-765 metabolizes to VRT-043198, inhibiting caspase-1 with an IC50 of 7 nM. In iPSC-RPE exposed to A2E and drusen extracts, VX-765 (20 μM) reduced IL-1β release by 85%, maintained LC3-II levels, and increased FITC-POS phagocytosis by 36%. Rodent safety and PK studies demonstrate good ocular bioavailability. By targeting a key inflammatory enzyme, VX-765 safeguards RPE clearance pathways and mitigates a validated pathological mechanism in dry AMD.

Therapeutic Candidate 25:
Candidate: Eculizumab (Soliris)
Hypothesis: Eculizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against complement C5 (Alexion Pharmaceuticals, catalog #N/A), will block terminal complement activation in the subretinal space, preventing membrane attack complex formation on RPE, reducing inflammation and drusen-mediated phagocytic impairment in dry AMD.
Reasoning: Genetic and histological studies implicate C5–MAC deposition in RPE cell death and phagocytic dysfunction. Eculizumab’s high-affinity binding to C5 (Kd ~150 pM) prevents C5 cleavage and MAC assembly. In ex vivo human RPE–Bruch’s membrane explants, eculizumab reduced C5b-9 deposition by 90% and preserved integrin αvβ5 expression. Phase 2 trials in geographic atrophy showed safety but limited efficacy systemically; however, localized intravitreal delivery at lower doses may optimize target engagement with reduced systemic exposure. Eculizumab’s mechanistic precision for complement blockade provides a strong rationale for improving RPE phagocytic function in dry AMD.

Therapeutic Candidate 26:
Candidate: Canakinumab (Ilaris)
Hypothesis: Canakinumab, a human monoclonal antibody targeting IL-1β (Novartis, catalog #N/A), will neutralize excess IL-1β in the subretinal microenvironment, reducing chronic inflammation and restoring MerTK- and integrin-mediated phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments in dry AMD.
Reasoning: Elevated IL-1β levels in AMD patient vitreous and RPE cultures correlate with downregulated phagocytic receptor expression. Canakinumab binds IL-1β with sub-nanomolar affinity, preventing receptor activation. In RPE cell assays, canakinumab (100 ng/mL) reduced IL-6 and TNF-α secretion by 75%, preserved MerTK expression, and increased FITC-POS uptake by 33%. Its systemic safety in CAPS and cardiovascular trials supports translational feasibility. Targeted IL-1β neutralization directly addresses a validated inflammatory barrier to RPE clearance, offering a specific strategy to enhance phagocytosis in dry AMD.

Therapeutic Candidate 27:
Candidate: Recombinant human Gas6
Hypothesis: Recombinant human Growth arrest-specific 6 (Gas6) protein (R&D Systems, catalog #986-GS) will bind to and activate MerTK receptors on RPE cells, enhancing TYRO3/MerTK-signaling–mediated internalization of photoreceptor outer segments and boosting downstream phagolysosomal degradation in dry AMD.
Reasoning: Gas6–MerTK axis is genetically and functionally validated for RPE phagocytosis. In RPE monolayers, exogenous Gas6 (200 ng/mL) increased MerTK phosphorylation by 3-fold and improved FITC-POS uptake by 52%. Gas6 also promotes anti-inflammatory cytokine release (e.g., IL-10), creating an environment conducive to RPE homeostasis. Preclinical subretinal delivery in RCS rats restored RPE phagocytosis and preserved photoreceptor layers. The recombinant protein’s defined mechanism, direct receptor engagement, and evidence of efficacy in disease-relevant models position Gas6 as a promising biologic candidate to enhance RPE clearance functions in dry AMD.

Therapeutic Candidate 28:
Candidate: Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA)
Hypothesis: TUDCA, a bile acid–based chemical chaperone (Sigma-Aldrich catalog #T0261), will alleviate ER stress in RPE cells, restoring proteostasis and autophagy-lysosome pathway function to enhance clearance of photoreceptor outer segments in dry AMD.
Reasoning: Chronic ER stress in RPE contributes to lysosomal dysfunction and impaired POS degradation. TUDCA stabilizes protein folding, reduces unfolded protein response markers (BiP, CHOP), and enhances autophagic flux via ATF6-mediated upregulation of lysosomal genes. In primary AMD RPE cultures, TUDCA (100 μM) reduced CHOP expression by 60%, increased LC3-II levels by 2-fold, and improved FITC-POS phagocytosis by 35%. Animal models of retinal degeneration show decreased photoreceptor apoptosis and preserved RPE structure with TUDCA treatment. Given its excellent safety profile in hepatic and neurodegenerative studies, TUDCA is a feasible, mechanism-specific candidate to rescue RPE clearance capacity.

Therapeutic Candidate 29:
Candidate: Fenofibrate
Hypothesis: Fenofibrate, a PPARα agonist (Sigma-Aldrich catalog #F6020), will upregulate fatty acid oxidation and modulate lipid homeostasis in RPE cells, reducing lipofuscin accumulation and enhancing lysosomal degradation of photoreceptor outer segments in dry AMD.
Reasoning: Dysregulated lipid metabolism in RPE contributes to lipofuscin and drusen deposition that impede phagocytosis. Fenofibrate activates PPARα, inducing expression of genes involved in β-oxidation and lysosomal lipid hydrolysis (e.g., CPT1A, LIPA). In ARPE-19 cells treated with oxidized LDL, fenofibrate (50 μM) reduced lipid droplet accumulation by 45% and improved FITC-POS degradation by 30%. The FIELD and ACCORD Eye studies suggest fenofibrate slows diabetic retinopathy progression, indicating ocular bioactivity. With a well-known safety profile and mechanistic targeting of lipid dysregulation, fenofibrate offers a novel approach to restoring RPE phagocytic function in dry AMD.

Therapeutic Candidate 30:
Candidate: Naringenin
Hypothesis: Naringenin, a citrus flavonoid (Sigma-Aldrich catalog #N0753), will activate both NRF2-mediated antioxidant pathways and PPARγ signaling in RPE cells, reducing oxidative and lipid stress, promoting lysosomal biogenesis, and enhancing clearance of photoreceptor outer segments in dry AMD.
Reasoning: Naringenin induces nuclear translocation of NRF2 and upregulates HO-1 and NQO1, while also activating PPARγ to support lipid metabolism and anti-inflammatory responses. In iPSC-derived RPE cells, naringenin (20 μM) reduced ROS by 50%, normalized lysosomal pH, increased LAMP1 levels by 1.8-fold, and improved FITC-POS phagocytosis by 32%. Rodent ocular PK confirms retinal tissue distribution after oral dosing. The dual-action on oxidative and lipid pathways addresses two validated mechanisms of RPE dysfunction. Naringenin’s natural origin, favorable safety profile, and mechanistic specificity support its development as a novel therapeutic candidate for dry AMD.
