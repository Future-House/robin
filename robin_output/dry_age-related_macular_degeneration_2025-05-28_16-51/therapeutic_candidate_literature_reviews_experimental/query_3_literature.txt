Query: Literature on repurposed drug candidates and chemical libraries demonstrating enhancement of RPE phagocytosis in high-content imaging or fluorescence-based assays, including documentation of engagement of defined molecular targets, ADME and ocular toxicity data in preclinical or early-phase clinical studies of ocular applications

The existing literature and clinical trial databases do not provide evidence of repurposed drug candidates or chemical library compounds that have been shown to enhance retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) phagocytosis using high-content imaging or fluorescence‐based assays along with concomitant documentation of target engagement, ADME, and ocular toxicity data in preclinical or early-phase clinical studies. A comprehensive search on ClinicalTrials.gov with the query “RPE phagocytosis AND (high-content imaging OR fluorescence assay) AND (repurposed OR chemical library) AND (ocular toxicity OR ADME)” returned zero clinical trials, which strongly suggests that no trials – ranging from preclinical to early-phase clinical studies – have been registered that address enhancement of RPE phagocytosis using these methods (Clinical Trials Search: RPE phagocytosis AND (high-content imaging OR fluorescence assay) AND (repurposed OR chemical library) AND (ocular toxicity OR ADME)).

The key published study by Hamm et al. focuses on the pharmacological inhibition of MERTK—a receptor tyrosine kinase critical for RPE phagocytosis—and its consequences on retinal degeneration (hamm2022pharmacologicalinhibitionof pages 1-2, 4-5, 7-9, 9-10). In this work, advanced imaging modalities, including high-content imaging and fluorescence-based assays, are used to quantify the uptake of FITC-labeled photoreceptor outer segments in human RPE cells. However, the objective was to demonstrate that inhibition of MERTK by a selective inhibitor (AZ14145845) impairs phagocytosis and leads to retinal toxicity, not to identify compounds that enhance phagocytosis. Additionally, while this study provides detailed pharmacokinetic (ADME) data and ocular toxicity assessments, its emphasis is on the detrimental effects of MERTK inhibition rather than on the enhancement of phagocytic function by repurposed compounds (hamm2022pharmacologicalinhibitionof pages 4-5, 7-9, 9-10).

Likewise, the review by Hellinen (2017) primarily addresses melanin binding and ocular drug transporters in the context of retinal drug delivery (hellinen2017melaninbindingand pages 62-64, 66-69). Although it provides valuable insights into the challenges of ocular pharmacokinetics and potential toxicity issues arising from drug-melanin interactions, it does not furnish any evidence of chemical library screening or repurposed drugs that specifically enhance RPE phagocytosis using high-content or fluorescence imaging platforms.

In summary, the current body of literature reveals that, while robust assay platforms exist and advanced imaging techniques are being effectively applied for ocular drug safety assessment and pharmacokinetics—as exemplified by the methodologies in the Hamm et al. study—there is no documented evidence of any repurposed drug candidates or chemical library compounds that enhance RPE phagocytosis in a manner that is comprehensively characterized by target engagement, ADME properties, and ocular toxicity data. This represents a significant gap in research that warrants future investigation, particularly if such screening strategies are to be implemented to identify compounds with potential therapeutic benefits for retinal degenerative diseases (Clinical Trials Search: RPE phagocytosis AND (high-content imaging OR fluorescence assay) AND (repurposed OR chemical library) AND (ocular toxicity OR ADME), hamm2022pharmacologicalinhibitionof pages 1-2, hellinen2017melaninbindingand pages 62-64).
