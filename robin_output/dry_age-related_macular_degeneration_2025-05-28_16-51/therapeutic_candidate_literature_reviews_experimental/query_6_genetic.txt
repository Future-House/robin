Query: Genetic, functional, and transcriptomic analyses identifying dysregulated RPE phagocytosis pathways in dry age-related macular degeneration, with emphasis on causative roles of ROCK, AMPK, sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling, ER stress pathways from human genome-wide association studies, patient-derived RPE models, and knockout animals

Current aggregated data from genetic and transcriptomic platforms indicate that there is little or no established genetic association between dysregulation of ROCK, AMPK, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) signaling, or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathways and dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) as determined by large-scale studies such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS) or curated transcriptomic datasets. Specifically, the Open Targets searches queried for target disease associations in dry AMD for these pathways yielded zero results, which implies that these pathways are neither causally implicated nor robustly supported by genetic or transcriptomic evidence in the context of dry AMD (OpenTargets Search: dry age-related macular degeneration-ROCK,AMPK,S1PR1,ER stress).

Functional studies, however, have provided more nuanced insight into the role of these signaling pathways in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) dysfunction—a critical component in dry AMD pathology. For instance, in vitro experiments using human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived RPE models have demonstrated that inhibition of ROCK signaling through small molecules such as Y-27632 leads to enhanced RPE wound repair, increased pigmentation, elevated expression of RPE65 (a key enzyme in the visual cycle), and notably improved phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) (Baileysteinitz2021developmentofin pages 87-91). These functional assays suggest that ROCK dysregulation may contribute to phagocytosis defects, and that pharmacological modulation of this pathway can rescue RPE functionality in a model that recapitulates aspects of dry AMD pathology (Baileysteinitz2021developmentofin pages 87-91).

Moreover, additional transcriptomic data derived from patient-derived iPSC-RPE models, such as those described in Neiteler (2019), reveal alterations in metabolic pathways that include significant changes in the AMPK signaling axis. These studies report upregulation of genes related to fatty acid β-oxidation and ketogenesis, concurrently with changes in markers of oxidative stress, suggesting that metabolic stress may be a factor in the observed RPE dysfunction (Neiteler2019establishingahuman pages 98-101). Although these transcriptomic signatures implicate AMPK pathway involvement as a response to cellular stress, direct genetic causation linking AMPK dysregulation to impaired RPE phagocytosis remains limited.

Regarding sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) signaling and ER stress pathways, the available literature does not provide functional, genetic, or transcriptomic analyses explicitly implicating their dysregulation in dry AMD. While isolated studies and reviews, such as those included in the Bailey-Steinitz (2021) series, note that these pathways have been proposed to contribute to the broader cellular stress responses in retinal degeneration, there is a lack of direct evidence from GWAS, patient-derived RPE models, or knockout animal studies to conclusively establish a causal role for S1P signaling or ER stress in RPE phagocytosis dysfunction (OpenTargets Search: dry age-related macular degeneration-ROCK,AMPK,S1PR1,ER stress; Bailey-Steinitz2021developmentofin pages 99-102).

In summary, while functional studies strongly support a role for ROCK signaling dysregulation in RPE dysfunction—with associated deficits in phagocytosis that can be rescued by ROCK inhibition—the genetic and transcriptomic evidence for dysregulation of AMPK, S1P signaling, and ER stress pathways in dry AMD remains underdeveloped. This discrepancy underscores the need for further investigation using comprehensive genetic analyses, patient-derived models, and knockout animal studies to resolve these potential mechanistic connections in dry AMD pathogenesis (Neiteler2019establishingahuman pages 98-101, Bailey-Steinitz2021developmentofin pages 87-91).
