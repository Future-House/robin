Query: Investigations into the roles of autophagy, lysosomal biogenesis, endosomal trafficking, and phagosome–lysosome fusion in retinal pigment epithelium outer segment clearance, including mechanistic studies in patient-specific stem cell models and in vivo validation in dry AMD rodent or primate models

The current body of research indicates that the clearance of photoreceptor outer segments by retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells is tightly regulated by autophagy, lysosomal biogenesis, endosomal trafficking, and phagosome–lysosome fusion. This clearance process is fundamental for maintaining retinal homeostasis, and its impairment is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (bharti2022cellculturemodels pages 1-3).

Mechanistic studies have demonstrated that RPE cells rely on a highly coordinated intracellular system that involves the engulfment of shed outer segments, their delivery to phagosomes, and subsequent fusion with lysosomes for degradation. The process is regulated by key signaling molecules such as mTORC1 and AMPK, which modulate autophagic flux and lysosomal acidification. Disruption in these molecular pathways leads to the accumulation of lipofuscin and other toxic deposits that contribute to AMD progression (kaarniranta2023autophagyinagerelated pages 2-3).

Specifically, autophagy plays a dual role in both basal clearance and the removal of damaged proteins and organelles following cellular stress. Studies using genetic models have shown that deletions or deficiencies in autophagy regulators, for example the essential autophagy inducer RB1CC1/FIP200, result in defective LC3 conversion and buildup of autophagic substrates, ultimately precipitating RPE degeneration and features akin to dry AMD (yao2015deletionofautophagy pages 1-2).

In addition to the canonical autophagy pathway, the fusion of phagosomes containing photoreceptor outer segments with lysosomes is a critical step that ensures efficient degradation of internalized material. Endosomal trafficking mediated by Rab GTPases such as Rab5 and Rab7 orchestrates the transport and maturation of these vesicles, while integrins and receptor tyrosine kinases, including MerTK, provide the extracellular cues necessary for initiating phagocytosis. Disruptions at any step can impede the timely clearance of debris and foster an environment conducive to retinal degeneration (keeling2018impairedcargoclearance pages 7-8).

Patient-specific in vitro RPE models derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have emerged as powerful tools for dissecting these molecular mechanisms in a genetically relevant context. These models recapitulate key aspects of RPE functionality, including outer segment phagocytosis and lysosomal processing, and have already revealed alterations in oxidative stress defenses and lysosomal enzyme activity that are observed in AMD (wiley2015patientspecificinducedpluripotent pages 7-7). Moreover, such cellular models allow detailed investigation into the impact of genetic risk alleles, which can modulate autophagy and endosomal dynamics, thus offering an opportunity to correlate patient-specific genetic backgrounds with defects in outer segment clearance (bharti2022cellculturemodels pages 29-32).

Complementing in vitro studies, preclinical validation in rodent and primate models is essential for linking cellular-level dysfunction to the complex in vivo environment of the retina. Various studies in rodent models have confirmed that impaired autophagy, lysosomal dysfunction, and defective phagosome–lysosome fusion are associated with outer segment clearance failure and subsequent RPE degeneration. Advanced imaging techniques such as pulse-chase assays and 3D confocal microscopy have been instrumental in quantifying the kinetics of these processes, further substantiating the mechanistic links observed in cell culture experiments (keeling2018impairedcargoclearance pages 8-11).

Despite robust preclinical evidence, clinical trials have yet to specifically target these cellular processes in RPE cells, underscoring a significant research gap in translational efforts for dry AMD. The integration of patient-specific stem cell models with clinically relevant animal models remains a critical future direction to validate these mechanisms and to develop targeted therapies aimed at restoring effective outer segment clearance in AMD (Clinical Trials Search: autophagy OR lysosomal biogenesis OR endosomal trafficking OR phagosome–lysosome fusion).
