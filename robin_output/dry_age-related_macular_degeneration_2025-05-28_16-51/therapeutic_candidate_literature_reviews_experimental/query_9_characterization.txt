Query: Characterization of receptor-mediated efferocytosis mechanisms in RPE cells, including integrins, TAM family receptors (MerTK, Axl), bridging molecules such as MFG-E8, and their dysregulation in dry AMD, based on gene editing, overexpression, and ligand-blocking studies in vitro and in AMD animal models

Receptor‐mediated efferocytosis in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells is a tightly regulated process that ensures removal of spent photoreceptor outer segment (POS) debris, thus maintaining retinal homeostasis. The process involves a cascade of events initiated by the recognition of “eat‐me” signals on apoptotic debris, followed by binding, internalization, and downstream anti‐inflammatory signaling. These functions are mediated by distinct families and classes of receptors, including members of the TAM (Tyro3, Axl, and MERTK) receptor tyrosine kinases, integrins, and bridging molecules like MFG‐E8.

MERTK (MER proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase) plays the central role in mediating RPE phagocytosis. Numerous gene editing studies, including knockout models, have unequivocally demonstrated that loss or inactivation of MERTK leads to a severe impairment in efferocytosis. This disruption results in the accumulation of POS debris, which in turn triggers an early inflammatory cascade and subsequent retinal degeneration that mimics aspects of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Gene editing experiments where MERTK is mutated (through knockout or kinase-inactivating mutations) have consistently shown that defective phagocytosis correlates with an increased inflammatory response and retinal degradation, highlighting the receptor’s dual functions in both debris clearance and anti-inflammatory signaling (ghosh2024intheeyes pages 3-5, lieffrig2023clearancephagocytosisby pages 19-20).

In contrast, Axl, another member of the TAM receptor family, has not been linked to RPE efferocytosis with the same degree of confidence. The experimental evidence from gene editing or ligand-blocking studies specifically implicating Axl in dry AMD pathology is limited when compared to MERTK, suggesting that either its role is redundant with that of MERTK or it plays a secondary, modulatory function in RPE homeostasis (OpenTargets Search: age-related macular degeneration-MerTK,Axl,integrin,MFG-E8).

Integrins, particularly the αvβ5 heterodimer, contribute to an essential early step in efferocytosis. The αvβ5 integrin receptor mediates POS debris binding through interaction with bridging molecules. Knockout studies or ligand-blocking experiments targeting integrin subunits in RPE cells have revealed a disruption in the initial recognition phase of POS, leading to compromised phagocytosis. However, despite their importance in the binding and internalization phase, integrins show comparatively lower association scores with AMD in animal models, indicating that while they are functionally critical in RPE efferocytosis, their dysregulation may not singularly drive AMD pathology (lieffrig2023clearancephagocytosisby pages 11-12, OpenTargets Search: age-related macular degeneration-MerTK,Axl,integrin,MFG-E8).

MFG-E8 functions as a bridging molecule linking apoptotic debris and integrin receptors. Secreted by RPE cells, it binds to phosphatidylserine on POS fragments and facilitates their engagement with αvβ5 integrin. In vitro studies have shown that a deficiency in MFG-E8, or blocking its interaction, results in impaired POS binding and engulfment. Although these mechanistic data point to a critical role of MFG-E8 in modulating RPE phagocytosis, direct evidence from overexpression or ligand-blocking studies in dry AMD animal models is sparse. Thus, while MFG-E8 is biochemically pivotal for proper efferocytosis, its direct impact on AMD pathology remains less substantiated compared to MERTK (lieffrig2023clearancephagocytosisby pages 11-12, OpenTargets Search: age-related macular degeneration-MerTK,Axl,integrin,MFG-E8).

Dysregulation in these coordinated receptor-mediated pathways is central to dry AMD pathogenesis. Gene editing studies involving MERTK mutations consistently illustrate that disruption of efferocytosis initiates a cascade of inflammatory events, leading to retinal degeneration. Furthermore, evidence suggests that compensatory mechanisms—such as the interplay between MERTK and its paralog TYRO3—can modulate the severity of degeneration, indicating that while isolation of a single pathway (for example, integrin or MFG-E8-mediated signaling) impairs POS clearance, the full degenerative phenotype is often a consequence of a broader network disruption. Overall, the balance between receptor-mediated clearance and anti-inflammatory signaling appears critical: when disrupted by gene editing, overexpression deficits, or ligand-blocking interventions, these pathways contribute to the accumulation of cellular debris and pro-inflammatory milieu observed in dry AMD (ghosh2024intheeyes pages 8-9, lieffrig2023clearancephagocytosisby pages 35-37, enderlin2024retinalatrophyinflammation pages 1-2).

In summary, while MERTK is the principal mediator of RPE efferocytosis with strong experimental backing from gene editing and knockout studies, integrins and bridging molecules such as MFG-E8 facilitate the initial recognition and internalization phases. The dysregulation of these pathways, particularly via MERTK dysfunction, orchestrates retinal inflammation and degeneration akin to dry AMD, underscoring the potential of targeting these pathways for therapeutic intervention (OpenTargets Search: age-related macular degeneration-MerTK,Axl,integrin,MFG-E8, ghosh2024intheeyes pages 9-11).
