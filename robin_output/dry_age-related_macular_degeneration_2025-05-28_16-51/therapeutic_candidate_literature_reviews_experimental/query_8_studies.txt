Query: Studies elucidating the interplay between chronic inflammation, complement activation, oxidative stress, and impaired RPE phagocytosis in the pathogenesis of dry age-related macular degeneration, detailing molecular mediators, feedback loops, and potential intervention points validated in animal or ex vivo human retinal tissues

Dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) is driven by an intricate interplay between chronic inflammation, complement system overactivation, oxidative stress, and impaired retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) phagocytosis. Central to this process is a series of well‐defined molecular mediators that not only drive individual pathological events but also reinforce feedback loops that exacerbate disease progression.

Genetic predispositions play an early and critical role in priming this cascade. Notably, polymorphisms in complement regulatory proteins—especially the CFH gene variant Y402H and ARMS2/HTRA1 mutations—alter lipid metabolism and extracellular matrix turnover. This leads to reduced clearance of oxidized phospholipids in the RPE membrane, excessive activation of the alternative pathway, and release of pro‐inflammatory mediators (basyal2024antioxidantsandmechanistic pages 4-5). The CFH dysfunction is further compounded by oxidative modifications of lipids such as malondialdehyde (MDA) and the accumulation of oxidized photoreceptor components which serve as damage‐associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that activate innate immunity (basyal2024antioxidantsandmechanistic pages 4-5).

The RPE’s normal function heavily relies on its capacity to phagocytose shed photoreceptor outer segments (POS), a process that is fundamentally disrupted by oxidative stress. High levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced during photo-oxidative exposure and mitochondrial activity, combined with the lipid-rich environment of the macula, promote lipid peroxidation. This peroxidation produces toxic byproducts like 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) and carboxyethyl pyrrole (CEP), which then further impair RPE autophagy and phagocytosis (basyal2024antioxidantsandmechanistic pages 5-7, fanjulmoles2016relationshipbetweenoxidative pages 8-9). The ensuing accumulation of lipofuscin and drusen not only disturbs the cellular milieu but also perpetuates the local inflammatory response, creating a self-sustaining cycle wherein impaired debris clearance leads to increasing oxidative burden and, in turn, further disruption of RPE phagocytic activity.

Complement activation constitutes both an initiating and amplifying mechanism in dry AMD. Overactivation of complement—partly driven by dysregulated CFH—results in the formation of anaphylatoxins (e.g., C3a and C5a) and the membrane attack complex (MAC), which directly damage RPE cells and enhance local inflammation (borchert2023theroleof pages 3-5, ibbett2017theimpactof pages 75-77). This complement-mediated cytotoxicity sets off a cascade of immune cell recruitment and microglial activation, further increasing the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8) and chemokines such as MCP-1, thereby reinforcing the vicious cycle of neuroinflammation and tissue degeneration (borchert2023theroleof pages 5-6, zhang2021innateimmunityin pages 90-91).

Feedback loops are fundamental to disease progression. Oxidative stress not only directly injures RPE cells but also augments complement activation by modifying cell surfaces and degrading complement regulatory proteins. In parallel, the impaired phagocytosis due to oxidative damage results in the accumulation of cellular debris and lipofuscin, which further triggers complement activation and chronic inflammation (pankova2016innateimmuneresponse pages 35-38). This establishes a cycle of parainflammation evolving into overt inflammatory damage that underpins the progression from early AMD to advanced forms such as geographic atrophy.

Validated intervention points have emerged from animal models and ex vivo human retinal tissue studies. Enhancing antioxidant defenses, for example through activation of Nrf2 pathways or exogenous antioxidant delivery, helps mitigate ROS-induced damage (buonfiglio2024recentadvancesin pages 12-14). Modulating complement activation using approaches that restore CFH function or inhibit downstream complement components (such as C3 and C5 inhibitors) has demonstrated efficacy in reducing complement-mediated tissue damage (borchert2023theroleof pages 3-5, tolentino2023sialicacidmimetic pages 20-21). In addition, strategies aimed at restoring RPE phagocytic efficiency—by targeting receptor pathways involved in phagosome handling—are promising approaches to break the cycle of debris accumulation and inflammation (basyal2024antioxidantsandmechanistic pages 5-7).

Collectively, the interplay among chronic inflammation, complement dysregulation, oxidative stress, and impaired RPE phagocytosis creates a network of feedback loops that promote retinal degeneration. Disrupting these interconnected pathways via antioxidant therapies, complement inhibition, and restoration of RPE phagocytic function represents a multifaceted therapeutic strategy to halt or reverse the progression of dry AMD (tolentino2023sialicacidmimetic pages 4-5, buonfiglio2024recentadvancesin pages 14-15).
