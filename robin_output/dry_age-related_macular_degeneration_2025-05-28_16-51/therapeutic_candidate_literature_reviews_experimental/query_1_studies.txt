Query: Studies reporting high-throughput fluorescence-based screening assays in retinal pigment epithelium phagocytosis evaluating novel small-molecule enhancers of photoreceptor outer segment clearance with robust target validation, mechanistic pathway confirmation, primary human RPE efficacy, and in vivo dry AMD animal model outcomes

A high‐throughput screening platform that fully meets all the specified criteria—namely, a fluorescence‐based assay for RPE phagocytosis that evaluates novel small‐molecule enhancers of photoreceptor outer segment (POS) clearance with robust target validation, mechanistic confirmation, efficacy in primary human RPE cells, and in vivo outcomes in dry AMD animal models—is not described in its entirety in the available literature.

One promising study established a high‐throughput, phenotypic screening assay using human embryonic stem cell–derived RPE cells in a 384‐well format. This platform identified small‐molecule enhancers such as ramoplanin (RM), which enhanced POS phagocytosis and even rescued the phagocytosis defect in MERTK-mutant RPE cells derived from patient iPSCs. The study provided mechanistic insight through RNA‐seq and qPCR analyses and utilized target inhibition (e.g., via S1PR5 inhibition) to confirm the underlying pathways, particularly involving actin dynamics and cytoskeletal remodeling. However, despite robust in vitro mechanistic validation, there was no evidence for testing in primary human RPE cells that are not stem cell–derived or evaluation in in vivo dry AMD animal models (karlUnknownyearsvenschreiterkaterina pages 1-2, karlUnknownyearsvenschreiterkaterina pages 10-11).

Another study detailed the development of a quantitative fluorescence‐based assay using FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) technology to measure the efficiency of photoreceptor outer segment trafficking within RPE cells. This assay utilizes fluorophores (e.g., NBD and FITC) and lysosomal markers to assess lysosomal fusion and degradation events following phagocytosis. It demonstrated that the loss of autophagy‐ and vacuolar sorting‐related gene function reduces the FRET signal, indicating a decrease in POS trafficking without affecting initial uptake. Although this work robustly validates molecular events during the phagocytic process and confirms the mechanistic pathway involved, it was not specifically adapted as a high‐throughput screening assay for small‐molecule discovery. Moreover, it did not extend to reports of efficacy in primary human RPE cells or include in vivo testing in dry AMD animal models (egbejimi2022decipheringunderlyingmechanisms pages 10-18, egbejimi2022decipheringunderlyingmechanisms pages 26-32).

Additional reports in the literature have focused on functional assays of RPE phagocytosis—emphasizing receptor involvement (αVβ5 integrin, MERTK) and the optimization of phagocytosis conditions in cell culture models—but they do not integrate fluorescence‐based high‐throughput screening methodologies designed for small‐molecule enhancer discovery. Studies addressing mitochondrial-targeted drug interventions or assessing RPE cell polarity and function have similarly not met the full criteria, as they lack both the comprehensive screening component and subsequent in vivo validation in AMD models (bharti2022cellculturemodels pages 11-12, ebeling2022testingmitochondrialtargeteddrugs pages 1-2).

Furthermore, reviews summarizing therapeutic approaches for AMD predominantly focus on gene therapy, complement inhibition, or other pharmacological strategies rather than on high‐throughput screening strategies aimed at enhancing RPE phagocytosis (plau2024ligandinteractionsand pages 44-48, luu2024…approachto pages 24-28).

In summary, while the development of high-throughput phenotypic assays and fluorescence-based tools targeting RPE phagocytosis—and even several robust in vitro validations—have been reported, no single study from the provided sources encompasses the complete translational pipeline, from high-throughput small-molecule screening with fluorescence readouts and mechanistic target confirmation to efficacy testing in primary human RPE cultures and in vivo dry AMD animal models (karlUnknownyearsvenschreiterkaterina pages 1-2, egbejimi2022decipheringunderlyingmechanisms pages 10-18).
