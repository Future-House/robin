Query: Publications characterizing small-molecule modulators of key phagocytic pathways in retinal pigment epithelium, including cytoskeleton remodeling, integrin engagement or autophagy induction, with biochemical target engagement assays, efficacy testing in primary human RPE or iPSC-derived RPE, and pharmacokinetic safety profiles

The current body of literature provides important mechanistic insight and preliminary characterization of small‐molecule approaches that might modulate key phagocytic pathways in RPE cells, but no single publication has yet fully met all the stringent criteria—namely, demonstrating cytoskeletal remodeling or integrin engagement or autophagy induction using small molecules with comprehensive biochemical target engagement assays, efficacy testing in primary human or iPSC‐derived RPE, and detailed pharmacokinetic and safety profiles.

For instance, Si et al. (si2023theroleof pages 2-4, si2023theroleof pages 9-10) offer a detailed description of the molecular processes underlying RPE phagocytosis and autophagy. Their discussion underscores that receptors such as MerTK, αvβ5 integrin, and CD36 are central to these processes and suggests that small molecules modulating these targets could theoretically influence phagocytosis and autophagy in RPE cells. They further note that compounds like rapamycin (an mTOR inhibitor) and AICAR (an AMPK activator) have been employed in experimental contexts to induce autophagy; however, these studies lack detailed biochemical target engagement assays and advanced pharmacokinetic and safety evaluations in human-relevant RPE models (si2023theroleof pages 10-12, si2023theroleof pages 16-17).

Equally important, the review by Fronk and Vargis (fronk2016methodsforculturing pages 14-15) offers robust methodologies for culturing RPE cells—whether primary or iPSC-derived—and describes the cellular and cytoskeletal features pertinent to phagocytosis. This work establishes a foundational framework that is highly relevant for assessing the efficacy of small-molecule modulators in vitro. However, it does not itself describe any specific small-molecule modulators with the complete set of pharmacologic parameters requested.

The most detailed small-molecule intervention is provided by Ramsden et al. (ramsden2017rescueofthe pages 2-3, ramsden2017rescueofthe pages 8-9). In these publications, the authors explored translational readthrough-inducing drugs—specifically, the aminoglycoside G418 and PTC124—to rescue phagocytic defects in MERTK-deficient iPSC-derived RPE. Their biochemical target engagement is supported by Western blot and immunocytochemistry data demonstrating MERTK protein restoration and by phagocytosis assays verifying partial functional recovery. Although PTC124 achieved a modest (~12%) improvement in phagocytic activity without adversely affecting control cells, these studies did not include full pharmacokinetic or comprehensive safety profiles, and they did not address modulation of cytoskeletal dynamics or integrin engagement directly (ramsden2017rescueofthe pages 2-3, ramsden2017rescueofthe pages 8-9).

Finally, additional insights into RPE function and maturation from studies using iPSC-derived cells (viherialaUnknownyearinvitromaturation pages 23-26, dehghan2022humaninducedpluripotentstem pages 15-16) provide further context for evaluating small-molecule effects. These reports underscore the viability of human iPSC-RPE as a platform for testing drug efficacy and safety; yet, they do not present detailed biochemical target engagement assays or full pharmacokinetic data for small molecules that might modulate phagocytic pathways.

In summary, while multiple publications provide mechanistic rationales and baseline efficacy data in human or stem cell-derived RPE, and while some candidate molecules (e.g., rapamycin, AICAR, PTC124) have been tested in vitro with partial biochemical validation, none have yet provided a complete characterization incorporating robust target engagement assays, efficacy in primary human or iPSC-derived RPE, along with detailed pharmacokinetic and safety profiles (si2023theroleof pages 2-4, si2023theroleof pages 9-10, fronk2016methodsforculturing pages 14-15, ramsden2017rescueofthe pages 2-3, ramsden2017rescueofthe pages 8-9).
