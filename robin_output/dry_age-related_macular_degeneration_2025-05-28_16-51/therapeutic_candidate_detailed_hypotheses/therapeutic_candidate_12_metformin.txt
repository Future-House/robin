Proposal for Metformin (Glucophage; generic)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Metformin, commercially known as Glucophage, is a small-molecule synthetic compound that belongs to the biguanide class of therapeutic agents originally derived from the natural product galegine found in Galega officinalis. Historically, metformin was developed to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus through its antihyperglycemic effects, and its synthesis and subsequent optimization led to a well‐characterized oral drug that is now one of the most prescribed medications worldwide. As a repurposing candidate, metformin offers the significant advantage of a long clinical history and an established safety profile, which are critical factors in drug development. Within its class, metformin stands out due to its capacity to modify cellular energy metabolism through inhibition of mitochondrial complex I, a mechanism that elevates the AMP/ATP ratio and subsequently activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). This activation of AMPK has been associated not only with improved metabolic control but also with pleiotropic effects—including modulation of autophagy, reduction of oxidative stress, and stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis—that make it an attractive candidate for diseases driven by metabolic inefficiency and cellular stress, such as dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (Brown et al., 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016).

Therapeutic History:
Metformin has a storied history in clinical practice, primarily as a first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes. Its established role in lowering blood glucose levels is underpinned by its ability to suppress hepatic gluconeogenesis and improve peripheral glucose uptake. Over decades of clinical use, metformin has also been associated with reduced risks of several age-related conditions, including cardiovascular disease and some forms of cancer. Intriguingly, epidemiological studies have reported an inverse association between metformin use and the incidence or progression of age-related macular degeneration. For example, retrospective analyses and case–control studies have observed that patients on metformin, even when adjusted for confounders such as glycemic control, exhibit reduced odds of developing AMD (Brown et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2022). Moreover, additional retrospective data from large insurance claims databases have yielded mixed but generally suggestive results of a protective effect in diabetic populations, spurring interest in repurposing metformin for dry AMD. Notably, a phase II clinical trial has been initiated to directly evaluate metformin’s clinical impact on the progression of geographic atrophy—a late manifestation of dry AMD—further providing a translational rationale for its repurposing (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016; Brown et al., 2019). While there are also studies evaluating metformin’s role in other retinal degenerative conditions (for instance, in ABCA4 retinopathy), these investigations underscore a broader biological plausibility that a drug influencing energy homeostasis and oxidative stress pathways can have retinal benefits, particularly in diseases with shared pathogenesis such as dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2020).

Mechanism of Action:
The biochemical actions of metformin are now well characterized in a metabolic context, and they translate into several molecular interactions of relevance to RPE cell biology. Primarily, metformin exerts its effects by inhibiting mitochondrial complex I of the electron transport chain, a mechanism that results in decreased production of ATP and a consequent increase in the AMP/ATP ratio. This energetic shift is sensed by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a master regulator of cellular energy homeostasis, which becomes activated through phosphorylation. Once activated, AMPK initiates multiple downstream effects that are beneficial in contexts of cellular stress. For example, AMPK activation promotes autophagy—a cellular process critical for the clearance of damaged organelles such as mitochondria (a process known as mitophagy) and protein aggregates—as well as lysosomal biogenesis, thereby enhancing the cell’s capacity to remove dysfunctional components (Chan et al., 2020; Brown et al., 2019).

In the context of dry AMD, the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress and metabolic dysregulation because of its high phagocytic activity required for the daily ingestion of photoreceptor outer segments (POS). The natural degradation of POS, when impaired, leads to the accumulation of toxic substances such as lipofuscin, ultimately jeopardizing cellular function. Metformin’s capability to elevate the AMP/ATP ratio spurs AMPK activation, which in turn induces autophagic clearance mechanisms. Enhanced autophagy facilitates the removal of damaged mitochondria and POS debris, potentially restoring RPE homeostasis and function. In addition, AMPK activation can stimulate lysosomal biogenesis, further supporting a robust autophagic flux and improved cellular recycling processes (Brown et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2020).

Beyond these direct effects on energy metabolism and autophagy induction, metformin may indirectly support MerTK-dependent phagocytosis. MerTK is a receptor tyrosine kinase crucial for the engulfment of POS by the RPE. Indirect modulation of this process through the restoration of a functional autophagy–lysosome pathway and reduction in oxidative stress may enhance RPE phagocytosis even if metformin does not directly interface with MerTK signaling (Brown et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2022). The interplay between AMPK activation, autophagy, and lysosomal function may thus represent a coherent mechanism by which metformin confers cellular protection and improves the phagocytic efficiency of the RPE under oxidative duress, which is central to the pathogenesis of geographic atrophy in dry AMD (Chan et al., 2020).

Expected Effect:
Given metformin’s established pharmacodynamics, the expected effect in the RPE of patients with dry AMD is multifaceted. In an assay designed to evaluate dry AMD pathogenesis, metformin is anticipated to exert a local impact on RPE cells by promoting improved clearance of damaged mitochondria and POS debris through the activation of autophagic and lysosomal processes. Specifically, the inhibition of complex I should lead to an elevated AMP/ATP ratio that triggers AMPK activity. This activation is expected to result in increased expression of autophagy markers such as LC3-II and a reduction in reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby diminishing oxidative damage in RPE cells. In vitro studies using ARPE-19 cells under conditions of oxidative stress have already observed an increase in autophagy markers and a reduction in ROS levels following metformin treatment, implying a beneficial effect on cellular homeostasis under stress conditions common in dry AMD (Qu et al., 2020; Eton et al., 2022).

Moreover, clinical studies have provided epidemiological support that metformin use correlates with lower incidences of AMD, suggesting that systemic exposure to the drug—achieved at micromolar concentrations through oral administration—may suffice to exert local retinal effects. This is further supported by pharmacokinetic data indicating that metformin can cross the blood–retinal barrier (BRB), reaching the RPE at physiologically relevant concentrations to modulate its metabolism (Brown et al., 2019; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016).

In a proposed assay, the expected outcome would be the restoration of autophagy–lysosome pathways in the RPE, resulting in enhanced degradation of intracellular debris and improved phagocytosis of POS debris—a process known to be dependent on MerTK function (Brown et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2022; Chan et al., 2020).

Overall Evaluation:
Metformin emerges as a promising candidate for repurposing in dry AMD primarily due to its well-documented safety profile, favorable pharmacokinetics, and a mechanistic basis that aligns with the pathophysiology of RPE degeneration. The strengths of metformin as a repurposed therapeutic include its established clinical use over decades, the robust epidemiological data suggesting an inverse association with AMD incidence, and its mechanistic action on energy metabolism. The inhibition of mitochondrial complex I leading to an elevated AMP/ATP ratio and subsequent activation of AMPK offers a direct biochemical route to enhance autophagy and lysosomal function in the stressed RPE. Through these mechanisms, metformin is expected to promote the clearance of damaged mitochondria and POS debris, thereby potentially restoring RPE phagocytic function via support of MerTK-dependent ingestion processes (Brown et al., 2019; Chan et al., 2020).

Furthermore, in vitro data—including studies demonstrating increased autophagic markers (e.g., LC3-II) and reduced ROS production in ARPE-19 cells exposed to oxidative stress—provide compelling preclinical evidence for metformin’s efficacy in a cellular model relevant to dry AMD (Qu et al., 2020). Epidemiological studies have reinforced that metformin users exhibit a lower risk of developing AMD, lending further support to the hypothesis that metformin’s metabolic modulation may confer retinal protection (Brown et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2022).

Despite these promising facets, there are also notable weaknesses and challenges associated with this repurposing effort. One limitation lies in the concentration of metformin achieved in the retina upon systemic administration. Although oral metformin is known to cross the BRB at micromolar levels, it remains to be definitively demonstrated whether these concentrations are sufficient to drive the full complement of desired autophagic and metabolic effects in the RPE in vivo under the chronic oxidative stress conditions found in dry AMD. Moreover, while epidemiological associations are encouraging, they remain subject to confounding factors, and the clinical evidence from retrospective analyses has at times been conflicting (Eton et al., 2022).

Another concern is the dual nature of metformin’s complex I inhibition. While this effect is central to its ability to activate AMPK, under conditions of high oxidative stress, such as those present in the RPE of AMD patients, further inhibition of mitochondrial respiration could theoretically exacerbate energy deficits and lead to cell death if the balance of energy supply and demand is not carefully managed (Chan et al., 2020). This underscores the need for precise dose optimization and a better understanding of the drug’s concentration–effect profile in retinal tissues.

There is also the issue of the specificity of metformin’s action. Although it primarily activates AMPK, metformin’s pleiotropic effects may involve additional pathways, some of which could have off‐target effects that might not be beneficial in the context of retinal degeneration. For instance, modulation of inflammatory responses and potential effects on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling have been observed, and while these may offer benefits in certain contexts, they require comprehensive evaluation in preclinical models of dry AMD (Brown et al., 2019; Chan et al., 2020).

In summary, metformin represents a highly attractive candidate due to its potent ability to activate AMPK, stimulate autophagy–lysosome pathways, and potentially improve MerTK-dependent phagocytosis of POS debris by the RPE. Its well-established safety in a broad patient population and epidemiological signals of retinal benefit further support its repurposing for dry AMD. Nonetheless, challenges remain in ensuring that therapeutic concentrations are achieved in the retina, that the balance of metabolic effects is maintained to prevent additional cellular stress, and that any off-target effects are identified and managed through careful preclinical and clinical studies. Future research should focus on dose-ranging studies, in vivo models that mimic the chronic oxidative stress seen in human RPE cells, and eventually, carefully controlled randomized clinical trials to definitively assess the efficacy of metformin in slowing the progression of geographic atrophy associated with dry AMD (Brown et al., 2019; Eton et al., 2022; Jiang et al., 2022; Chan et al., 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016).

Overall, the hypothesis that metformin-mediated complex I inhibition will elevate the AMP/ATP ratio in AMD RPE cells, leading to AMPK activation, enhanced autophagy, lysosomal biogenesis, and improved MerTK-dependent phagocytosis is well-supported by both mechanistic insights and epidemiological observations. While further work is required to delineate optimal dosing and confirm targeted retinal effects in vivo, the potential benefits observed in cellular and animal models, combined with the drug’s long clinical track record, make metformin a promising candidate for the treatment of dry age-related macular degeneration. Given these considerations, it is recommended that the research team proceed with further preclinical studies to examine retinal tissue–specific pharmacodynamics and optimize dosing protocols, followed by early-phase clinical trials to evaluate the therapeutic impact on geographic atrophy progression in dry AMD patients (Brown et al., 2019; Qu et al., 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016).
