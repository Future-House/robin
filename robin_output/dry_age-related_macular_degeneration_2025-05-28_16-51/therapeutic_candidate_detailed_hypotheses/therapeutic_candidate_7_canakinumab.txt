Proposal for Canakinumab (Ilaris; Novartis)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Canakinumab (Ilaris; Novartis) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that targets interleukin‐1β (IL‐1β), a key pro‐inflammatory cytokine with central roles in immune and inflammatory responses. Developed using advanced recombinant DNA and hybridoma technologies, canakinumab belongs to the class of biologics known as cytokine inhibitors. Its molecular design involves the humanization of an antibody to ensure high affinity and specificity for IL‐1β while minimizing immunogenicity. This therapeutic candidate was originally discovered in the context of autoinflammatory diseases and has since been applied in conditions where IL‐1β is a major pathogenic driver. Biologic compounds such as canakinumab work by binding to circulating IL‐1β and thereby preventing it from interacting with the interleukin‐1 receptor (IL‐1R), which is critical for triggering downstream signaling cascades including the nuclear factor‐κB (NF‐κB) pathway. This class of compounds has achieved success in treating cryopyrin‐associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) and other inflammatory disorders, establishing their efficacy in modulating cytokine‐mediated disease processes (Fabiani et al., 2017; Marketos et al., 2018).

Therapeutic History:
Canakinumab has been extensively studied in various systemic inflammatory conditions characterized by dysregulated IL‐1β production. Its clinical utility has been demonstrated in auto-inflammatory syndromes such as CAPS, Adult Onset Still’s Disease, Familial Mediterranean Fever, and TRAPS, as well as in rheumatoid arthritis, where patients refractory to anti–tumor necrosis factor agents have responded to IL‐1β blockade. These applications underscore its potent anti-inflammatory effects and favorable safety profile, with well‐characterized pharmacokinetics allowing for dosing intervals as long as one month or even quarterly in some indications (Fabiani et al., 2017; Marketos et al., 2018).
In the realm of ophthalmology, IL‐1β has been implicated in various retinal degenerative and inflammatory diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, uveitis, and age‐related macular degeneration (AMD). While canakinumab was primarily evaluated in a Phase I clinical trial investigating its safety and tolerability in patients with wet AMD – as seen in the trial identified as NCT00503022 – there is a growing mechanistic rationale to consider its repurposing for dry AMD as well (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2006). Although direct published clinical trial evidence for canakinumab in dry AMD is presently limited, the extensive preclinical research elucidating inflammasome activation and IL‐1β’s role in RPE (retinal pigment epithelium) inflammation provides a strong foundation for further investigation into its use in this indication (Brandstetter, 2016; Kauppinen et al., 2016).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, canakinumab acts by binding specifically to IL‐1β, thereby neutralizing it and preventing its interaction with IL‐1 receptor type I (IL‐1RI). IL‐1β is produced as an inactive precursor and is cleaved to its active form through the action of caspase‐1 within the inflammasome—a multiprotein complex that becomes activated in response to various cellular stressors, including oxidative stress, lysosomal membrane permeabilization, and accumulation of damaged cellular components. In the context of dry AMD, chronic oxidative stress and the accumulation of toxic by-products in the RPE trigger the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Activated NLRP3 recruits the adaptor protein ASC and procaspase‐1, facilitating the conversion of procaspase‐1 into active caspase‐1, which then processes pro–IL‐1β into its mature, secreted form (Brandstetter, 2016; Gao et al., 2015).
The release of IL‐1β into the retinal microenvironment sets off a cascade of pro‐inflammatory events. IL‐1β binds to IL‐1RI on RPE cells and neighboring immune cells (such as microglia), which in turn activates intracellular signaling pathways including NF‐κB. Activation of NF‐κB results in the transcriptional upregulation of numerous inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as IL‐6, TNF‐α, and MCP‐1. These mediators contribute to a feed-forward loop that perpetuates inflammation, promotes the recruitment of additional inflammatory cells, and can disturb the homeostatic functions of the RPE, including its autophagic and phagocytic activities (Shafi et al., 2024; Chen & Xu, 2015).
Moreover, a significant body of preclinical work has demonstrated that inflammasome activation in the RPE is closely linked to impaired autophagy and dysfunctional clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (POS). The accumulation of intracellular lipofuscin and other toxic metabolites further exacerbates oxidative damage and RPE degeneration. By neutralizing IL‐1β, canakinumab is expected to dampen these downstream pro-inflammatory signals, thereby reducing NF‐κB activation and interrupting the deleterious feedback loop that maintains chronic inflammation in the RPE (Brandstetter, 2016; Korhonen, 2024).
The specificity of canakinumab for IL‐1β is particularly important because it allows for the targeted suppression of this cytokine without broadly impairing other components of host immunity. However, it should be noted that while canakinumab decreases circulating IL‐1β, it does not directly inhibit the activation of the inflammasome complex itself, and therefore, other downstream mediators such as IL‐18 may remain active (Wooff et al., 2019). This selective inhibition may be advantageous in terms of safety but could potentially limit the scope of anti-inflammatory effects if IL‐18 also contributes significantly to the degenerative processes in dry AMD (Wooff et al., 2019).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis driving the repurposing of canakinumab for dry AMD is that systemic administration of this anti–IL‐1β antibody will lower retinal IL‐1β levels, thereby dampening inflammasome-driven pyroptosis and the overall parainflammatory cytokine milieu. In the proposed mechanism, this reduction in IL‐1β would result in decreased activation of NF‐κB and subsequent downregulation of a host of inflammatory mediators, thus establishing a less toxic microenvironment for RPE cells (Tan et al., 2020; Shafi et al., 2024).
Preclinical studies have shown that IL‐1β plays a pivotal role in mediating RPE cell apoptosis, pyroptosis, and impaired autophagic flux. For example, in vitro experiments with RPE cell lines, such as ARPE-19, have demonstrated that stimulation with IL‐1β reduces cell viability, increases expression of pro-inflammatory mediators, and disrupts normal autophagic processes that are essential for the phagocytosis of POS (Chen et al., 2015; Korhonen, 2024). By neutralizing IL‐1β, canakinumab is expected to restore autophagic function and enhance the phagocytic capacity of the RPE. Improved autophagy would allow for more efficient clearance of damaged proteins and organelles, reducing oxidative stress and preserving the integrity of photoreceptors over time (Korhonen, 2024; Kauppinen et al., 2016).
Furthermore, available pharmacokinetic data – as suggested by several preclinical studies and some pharmacokinetic studies – indicate that systemic administration of canakinumab leads to detectable levels of the drug in the vitreous humor. Its long half-life supports the feasibility of monthly or quarterly dosing, aligning with the chronic nature of dry AMD and the need for sustained anti-inflammatory effects (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2006). The expected outcome is that inhibition of IL‐1β will not only mitigate inflammation and reduce pyroptotic cell death but will also indirectly enhance RPE autophagy and POS phagocytosis, potentially slowing or halting the progression of geographic atrophy associated with dry AMD (Brandstetter, 2016; Shafi et al., 2024).

Overall Evaluation:
In evaluating canakinumab as a therapeutic candidate for dry age-related macular degeneration, several key strengths and challenges must be considered.

Strengths:
1. The strong mechanistic rationale for targeting IL‐1β in dry AMD is supported by extensive preclinical evidence indicating that IL‐1β is a central mediator of RPE inflammation and is closely linked to the processes of oxidative stress, impaired autophagy, and dysfunctional clearance of photoreceptor outer segments. Multiple studies have demonstrated that blocking IL‐1β can attenuate inflammasome-mediated inflammatory cascades in retinal cells (Brandstetter, 2016; Chen & Xu, 2015; Wooff et al., 2019).
2. Canakinumab is a well-characterized biologic with proven efficacy in reducing systemic inflammation in a range of autoinflammatory and cardiovascular conditions. Its established safety profile and dosing convenience (monthly or quarterly dosing due to its long half-life) make it an attractive candidate for repurposing, as it minimizes the risks often associated with new drug entities (Fabiani et al., 2017; Marketos et al., 2018).
3. Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that systemic administration of canakinumab can achieve detectable levels in the vitreous humor, suggesting that sufficient drug concentrations may be reached in the retinal compartment to exert an anti-inflammatory effect on RPE cells (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2006).
4. The specificity of canakinumab for IL‐1β allows for targeted modulation of a key pro-inflammatory pathway without broadly impairing immune function. This selective mechanism of action is beneficial in chronic conditions such as dry AMD where long-term treatment may be required (Shafi et al., 2024; Tan et al., 2020).

Weaknesses and Limitations:
1. Despite the compelling preclinical evidence linking IL‐1β to dry AMD pathology, clinical data supporting the efficacy of canakinumab in retinal degenerative diseases remains sparse. For instance, while a Phase I trial (NCT00503022) in wet AMD has been completed to assess safety and tolerability following systemic administration, there is a lack of robust clinical trial data specifically targeting dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2006).
2. Canakinumab’s mechanism of action, while effective at neutralizing IL‐1β, does not directly inhibit upstream inflammasome activation or downstream inflammatory mediators such as IL‐18. Some studies suggest that IL‐18 may also play a role in AMD pathogenesis; hence, sole IL‐1β blockade might not fully abrogate the inflammatory cascade in RPE cells (Wooff et al., 2019; Korhonen, 2024).
3. The complexity of AMD pathogenesis, which involves not only chronic inflammation but also oxidative stress, complement activation, and autophagic dysfunction, means that a single therapeutic intervention may be insufficient. A combinational approach targeting multiple pathways may be required to achieve optimal therapeutic outcomes (Marneros, 2016; Kauppinen et al., 2016).
4. Evidence suggesting improvement of autophagic flux or enhanced phagocytosis in the RPE by IL‐1β inhibition is largely based on in vitro models and preclinical studies using ARPE-19 cells. Translating these findings into the complex human retinal environment, where multiple cell types interact, is challenging (Chen et al., 2015; Korhonen, 2024).
5. While systemic administration has the advantage of reaching the retinal compartment, potential systemic side effects and the actual level of drug penetration into the eye remain a critical concern. Although pharmacokinetic studies suggest detectable vitreous levels, it is uncertain if the achieved concentrations are sufficient to substantially modulate IL‐1β activity in the diseased retina (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2006).

Overall, canakinumab presents a promising strategy for the treatment of dry AMD based on its capacity to neutralize IL‐1β, a pivotal cytokine implicated in RPE inflammation, inflammasome activation, and subsequent autophagic blockade. The extensive preclinical data support the idea that dampening IL‐1β activity can alleviate RPE cell stress, reduce the parainflammatory cytokine milieu, and potentially preserve photoreceptor function by restoring proper phagocytic and autophagic processes. However, the lack of direct clinical trial data in dry AMD, coupled with the potential limitations of IL‐1β–only inhibition in a multifactorial disease, suggests that while the mechanistic rationale is sound, further rigorous clinical investigation is essential. Future studies should aim to define optimal dosing strategies, assess retinal pharmacokinetics in greater detail, and determine whether combination therapies targeting additional inflammatory pathways might be necessary to achieve clinically meaningful benefits in patients with dry AMD (Shafi et al., 2024; Marneros, 2023; Korhonen, 2024).

In summary, canakinumab is a well-characterized, systemic IL‐1β inhibitor with a strong mechanistic rationale for use in dry AMD owing to its ability to neutralize a key driver of RPE inflammation and inflammasome-mediated damage. Its proven efficacy in other inflammatory conditions, favorable pharmacokinetic profile, and targeted mechanism of action provide compelling support for its further evaluation. Nonetheless, the complexity of AMD pathogenesis, the partial scope of cytokine blockade, and the limited clinical data in ocular degenerations indicate that additional preclinical studies and dedicated clinical trials in dry AMD patients are warranted before definitive conclusions can be reached regarding its therapeutic utility. This candidate should be prioritized for further research with an eye towards combination strategies that may address the multifactorial nature of dry AMD pathology (Fabiani et al., 2017; Marneros, 2023; Mendiola & Cardona, 2018).
