Proposal for SR9009 (4-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-(pyridin-4-ylmethyl)thieno[3,2-d]pyrimidin-2-amine; Sigma-Aldrich Cat# SML3099)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
SR9009 is a fully synthetic small‐molecule agonist designed to specifically activate the nuclear receptor REV-ERBα (also known as NR1D1), a key transcription factor originally discovered in studies of circadian regulation and metabolic homeostasis. The molecule, chemically defined as 4-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-(pyridin-4-ylmethyl)thieno[3,2-d]pyrimidin-2-amine and commercially available via Sigma-Aldrich (Cat# SML3099), was initially developed as a biochemical probe to interrogate the roles of REV-ERBα in gene regulation, metabolism, and inflammatory processes in various tissues (Chen et al., 2023). Belonging to the class of synthetic nuclear receptor ligands, SR9009 acts by binding directly to REV-ERBα and modulating its transcriptional repressive activity, thereby indirectly influencing downstream target genes such as NRF2, an essential regulator of antioxidant enzyme expression. Over the years, this class of compounds has been utilized primarily in preclinical research to study circadian biology, metabolic diseases (including obesity and diabetes), and to explore their potential anti-inflammatory properties; these compounds have been shown to exert pleiotropic effects by shifting cellular energy balance and oxidative capacity in tissues highly susceptible to stress (Chen et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2022).

Therapeutic History:
While SR9009 itself has never reached formal clinical use for dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), its extensive preclinical evaluation in various models provides a robust foundation for its repurposing in retinal diseases. Biochemically, SR9009 has been used in several research studies focused on mitigating oxidative stress and improving mitochondrial function. For example, studies in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) models have demonstrated that SR9009 rescues damage induced by oxidative agents such as paraquat, thereby restoring mitochondrial respiration and cellular viability (Huang et al., 2022). In vivo, animal models using sodium iodate to induce RPE damage—a well-established model of dry AMD—have shown that administration of SR9009 results in a significant reduction in RPE lesion area, with one study reporting a roughly 50% reduction in lesion size at a dose of 100 mg/kg (Chen et al., 2023). Though its primary research applications have been in the contexts of metabolic syndrome, muscle cell viability, and even certain aspects of cancer biology, the pharmacological properties emerging from these preclinical studies demonstrate that SR9009 penetrates the blood–retinal barrier and exhibits favorable oral pharmacokinetics that are essential for any drug targeting ocular tissues (Chen et al., 2023; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). The history of nuclear receptor agonists in therapeutic development has shown that targeting transcription factors such as REV-ERBα can modulate disease-relevant pathways across multiple tissues; although clinical evidence remains scant, the translational potential of this approach is increasingly being recognized (Dwyer et al., 2011).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, REV-ERBα functions as a redox-sensitive, ligand-dependent nuclear receptor that is intricately involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms, lipid and glucose metabolism, mitochondrial biogenesis, inflammatory responses, and cellular autophagy. REV-ERBα lacks the canonical activation function AF-2 domain, instead operating primarily as a transcriptional repressor through its interaction with nuclear receptor corepressors and histone deacetylases. Upon binding of SR9009, REV-ERBα undergoes a conformational change that stabilizes its repressive state on target gene promoters. A critical downstream target is the gene encoding NRF2 (NFE2L2), a master regulator of antioxidant responses. NRF2, upon activation, translocates to the nucleus and binds to antioxidant response elements (ARE) in the promoters of key antioxidative enzymes, including superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) and catalase, thereby upregulating their transcription (Chen et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2022). This mechanism directly links REV-ERBα activation with enhanced cellular antioxidant defenses, which is essential in counteracting oxidative stress in RPE cells. Furthermore, activation of REV-ERBα by SR9009 has been associated with improvements in mitochondrial function. Preclinical data indicate that treatment with SR9009 increases oxygen consumption rate (OCR) during both basal and maximal respiratory states in ARPE-19 cells subjected to oxidative challenges, which suggests an enhancement in mitochondrial bioenergetics and a reduction in mitochondrial dysfunction (Huang et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2023). Additionally, the integrity of phagocytosis in RPE cells, a process critical for the daily clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (POS), is maintained via MerTK (MER tyrosine kinase)-dependent pathways. Although direct mechanistic studies on MerTK modulation by SR9009 in the context of dry AMD are limited, the activation of REV-ERBα is postulated to support phagocytic function possibly by preserving cytoskeletal dynamics, enhancing the autophagy–lysosome flux and maintaining proper mitochondrial metabolism required for the energy-intensive process of phagocytosis (Dwyer et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2022). The overall mechanism thus provides a multifaceted therapeutic intervention where SR9009 precisely modulates oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired phagocytosis—the central pathological features driving dry AMD progression (Chen et al., 2023; Basyal et al., 2024).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis guiding the use of SR9009 for dry AMD is that pharmacological activation of REV-ERBα in RPE cells under conditions of oxidative stress will induce NRF2 transcriptional activity, leading to a robust upregulation of antioxidative enzymes such as SOD1 and catalase. These antioxidant enzymes are responsible for neutralizing reactive oxygen species (ROS) that accumulate due to environmental stressors, high metabolic demand, and light exposure, all of which contribute to the oxidative burden in RPE cells (Chen et al., 2023; Basyal et al., 2024). By increasing antioxidant capacity, SR9009 is expected to restore the redox balance, thereby protecting RPE cells from subsequent oxidative damage and preserving their cellular integrity. Concurrently, upregulation of NRF2-mediated pathways should enhance mitochondrial biogenesis and improve the function of existing mitochondria, consequently restoring ATP production and overall cellular bioenergetics (Chen et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2022). Given that mitochondrial dysfunction is a key contributor to RPE degeneration in dry AMD, these effects are anticipated to play a central role in halting or delaying disease progression.

In addition to mitigating oxidative stress and preserving mitochondrial function, the activation of REV-ERBα by SR9009 is hypothesized to improve the autophagy–lysosome flux within RPE cells. Efficient autophagy is essential for the clearance of accumulated photoreceptor outer segments (POS) and other cellular debris, processes that are naturally dependent on MerTK-mediated phagocytosis. In the context of dry AMD, the impaired clearance of these debris leads to drusen formation and further exacerbation of retinal degeneration. Preclinical evidence suggests that SR9009 treatment in RPE models enhances phagocytic uptake and cytoskeletal dynamics—factors critical for the function of the MerTK receptor during POS clearance (Huang et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2023). The combined effect of increased antioxidant enzyme expression, improved mitochondrial function, and enhanced autophagic flux is expected to restore RPE homeostasis and, by extension, photoreceptor viability. Expression analyses have confirmed the presence of both REV-ERBα and MerTK in RPE cells, supporting the cellular basis for this integrated mechanism (Dwyer et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2022). Consequently, the expected result is not only a reduction in oxidative damage markers and a normalization of mitochondrial respiratory parameters but also a measurable improvement in the phagocytic clearance of POS, which should translate to preserved or even improved retinal function in experimental models of dry AMD (Chen et al., 2023; Basyal et al., 2024).

Overall Evaluation:
SR9009 presents as a highly promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of dry age-related macular degeneration based on its ability to target and modulate multiple interrelated pathways implicated in RPE dysfunction. One of the key strengths of SR9009 is its mechanism of action; by specifically activating REV-ERBα, it not only exerts antioxidant effects through enhanced NRF2 transcriptional activity but also restores mitochondrial function and supports the autophagy–lysosome pathway, which are all critically perturbed in dry AMD. The compound’s documented efficacy in preclinical models—including its ability to significantly reduce RPE lesion areas in sodium iodate-induced injury models and rescue oxidative stress-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in ARPE-19 cells—underscores its potential for translational application (Chen et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2022). Its favorable pharmacokinetic profile, robust oral bioavailability, and demonstrated blood–retinal barrier penetration further contribute to its attractiveness as a repurposed drug candidate in the field of retinal therapeutics (Chen et al., 2023; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

However, several considerations underscore the challenges ahead. First, while preclinical research has provided compelling evidence for the beneficial effects of SR9009 in RPE models, its safety and efficacy in human subjects remain unvalidated, necessitating extensive clinical investigation. The translation of findings from animal models to human clinical outcomes in AMD has historically been fraught with difficulties, especially given the multifactorial nature of the disease and the influence of chronic, cumulative stressors over decades (Dwyer et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2023). Second, the specificity of SR9009 for REV-ERBα over other nuclear receptors or off-target effects remains a critical area of exploration, as broad-spectrum modulation of nuclear receptor signaling could potentially result in unforeseen side effects. It is essential to further elucidate the precise pathways by which REV-ERBα activation modulates downstream effectors such as NRF2, and to establish that these effects occur predominantly in RPE cells without adversely affecting other retinal cell types or systemic metabolic processes (Chen et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2022).

Furthermore, although improvements in mitochondrial function and phagocytosis have been observed in vitro and in animal models, the long-term impact of such changes on disease progression, visual acuity, and overall retinal architecture in dry AMD patients remains to be determined. It will be important to assess whether SR9009’s effects on autophagy–lysosome dynamics and MerTK-dependent phagocytosis can consistently ameliorate the drusen accumulation and geographic atrophy that characterize advanced dry AMD (Basyal et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2023). In addition, the interplay between circadian rhythms, REV-ERBα activity, and inflammatory processes in the RPE suggests that the timing of drug administration may be an important factor in maximizing therapeutic efficacy—a complexity that should not be overlooked in future clinical studies (Wang et al., 2025; Choudhary & Malek, 2016).

In conclusion, the preclinical data supporting the use of SR9009 as a modulator of REV-ERBα in RPE cells is encouraging, particularly in light of its strong mechanistic rationale, demonstrated biochemical efficacy, and promising pharmacological properties. The strengths of this therapeutic candidate lie in its multifaceted approach: by simultaneously addressing oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired autophagy, and suboptimal phagocytic clearance, SR9009 targets the fundamental cellular defects underlying dry AMD (Chen et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2022). The potential to restore retinal homeostasis and slow the progression of retinal degeneration represents a significant advancement over current therapies, which are limited in treating the atrophic form of AMD. Nonetheless, rigorous clinical testing and further mechanistic studies are warranted to confirm its efficacy and safety in humans, to optimize dosing regimens, and to fully characterize its off-target profiles. Taken together, SR9009 is a compelling candidate for repurposing in the treatment of dry AMD, offering a targeted and potentially disease-modifying therapeutic strategy that merits further development (Chen et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2022; Dwyer et al., 2011).
