Proposal for Pegcetacoplan (APL-2)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Pegcetacoplan (Apellis code APL-2) is a synthetic cyclic peptide derived from the compstatin family that specifically targets the complement protein C3. Originally discovered through combinatorial peptide screening methods such as phage display, compstatin analogues were developed to achieve high binding affinity to C3 by interfering with its interaction with the C3 convertase complex (Lamers et al., 2022, pp. 4–6). Pegcetacoplan distinguishes itself from earlier compstatins by being PEGylated – that is, conjugated to polyethylene glycol chains – which improves its solubility, prolongs its plasma half-life, and enhances its overall pharmacokinetic profile (Lamers et al., 2022, pp. 6–7). As a member of the peptide complement inhibitor class, pegcetacoplan exhibits several attributes common to this group of therapeutic compounds; historically, these compounds have been explored in both systemic and ocular conditions where dysregulated complement activation plays a pathological role. Notably, the therapeutic class has been utilized in conditions such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and has been repurposed for ocular diseases like dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) due to its capacity to modulate complement-driven inflammation (Lamers et al., 2022, pp. 7–9; Ong et al., 2024, pp. 16–17).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, the development of compstatin derivatives such as pegcetacoplan has evolved over several decades of research focused on modulating the complement cascade in various inflammatory and degenerative diseases. Preclinical and early-phase clinical studies demonstrated that targeting complement C3 could reduce pathological complement activation and yield meaningful anti-inflammatory effects in animal models and in early human trials. Initially, pegcetacoplan was investigated as a systemic agent for complement-mediated disorders, with prior regulatory approval in conditions like PNH serving as an important proof-of-concept for its safety and efficacy in systemic dosing regimens (Lamers et al., 2022, pp. 6–7; Ong et al., 2024, pp. 16–17). More recently, its potential has been repurposed specifically for the treatment of dry AMD and geographic atrophy (GA), an advanced form of AMD characterized by progressive retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cell death and photoreceptor degeneration. The seminal phase II FILLY trial in GA demonstrated that monthly intravitreal administration of pegcetacoplan resulted in a significant reduction of GA lesion growth rates compared with sham injections, with every-other-month dosing also showing benefit albeit at a somewhat lower magnitude (Antonio-Aguirre & Arevalo, 2023, pp. 4–7; Halawa et al., 2021, pp. 2–4). Moreover, phase III clinical trials (DERBY and OAKS) further validated pegcetacoplan’s efficacy by demonstrating statistically significant slowing of lesion progression in patients with GA secondary to dry AMD, thereby reinforcing the translational feasibility of repurposing this therapeutic candidate for ocular indications (Ong et al., 2024, pp. 17–19; Patel et al., 2022, pp. 7–9). The consistent findings across biochemical models, animal studies, and clinical trials have established pegcetacoplan as a promising candidate not only from a pharmacodynamic perspective but also in terms of its safety profile, given the acceptable adverse event rates observed in repeated intravitreal administrations (Dascalu et al., 2024, pp. 1–2; Halawa et al., 2021, pp. 4–6).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, pegcetacoplan functions by binding to the central complement protein C3 and its activation product C3b. Complement C3 is a pivotal element within the complement cascade, acting as the convergence point for the classical, alternative, and lectin pathways. Upon activation by cleavage, C3 yields fragments C3a and C3b; C3a is a potent anaphylatoxin that promotes inflammation, while C3b plays a critical role in opsonization and in the formation of C3 convertases essential for proceeding to further steps in the cascade, such as the formation of C5 convertases that ultimately lead to assembly of the membrane attack complex (MAC) (Lamers et al., 2022, pp. 4–6; Qin et al., 2021, pp. 4–5). Pegcetacoplan’s mechanism is mediated by its competitive binding to the MG4/MG5 domain of C3, which sterically hinders the substrate’s cleavage by the C3 convertase. As a result, pegcetacoplan effectively suppresses the generation of C3a, C3b, and subsequent downstream inflammatory mediators such as C5a (Cruz-Pimentel & Wu, 2023, pp. 1–3; Lamers et al., 2022, pp. 6–7). This inhibition yields dual benefits: first, it directly reduces the inflammatory milieu by decreasing the release of anaphylatoxins; and second, it halts the amplification loop of the complement cascade, thereby preventing the deposition of complement activation products on retinal cells. In the context of dry AMD, excessive C3 activation is linked to chronic inflammation, drusen formation through complement deposition, and ultimately RPE degradation (Patel et al., 2022, pp. 14–16; Qin et al., 2024, pp. 2–3). Biochemical evidence also supports that complement dysregulation leads to impaired phagocytic function of the RPE because excessive deposition of C3 fragments (C3b) on photoreceptor outer segments interferes with normal clearance mechanisms (Borchert et al., 2023, pp. 8–10; Dascalu et al., 2024, pp. 23–24). By inhibiting the cleavage of C3, pegcetacoplan reduces the burden of C3b deposition, which in turn may facilitate the restoration of normal RPE phagocytosis and cytokine regulation (Antonio-Aguirre & Arevalo, 2023, pp. 4–7). Structural and molecular studies on compstatin derivatives have revealed detailed interactions between the cyclic peptide moiety and the target protein, confirming the high target specificity that underpins pegcetacoplan’s potent inhibitory activity (Lamers et al., 2022, pp. 7–9).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis driving the therapeutic use of pegcetacoplan in dry AMD is that by preventing the cleavage of complement C3, the drug will reduce chronic complement activation in the subretinal space, thereby addressing several pathological mechanisms responsible for disease progression. In the subretinal environment, chronic complement activation contributes to the formation of drusen—deposit accumulations rich in complement components and inflammatory mediators—, RPE inflammation, and ultimately the death of RPE cells and photoreceptors. By blocking C3 activation, pegcetacoplan is expected to decrease the formation of these deleterious deposits and reduce local inflammation (Guimaraes et al., 2022, p. 4; Tzoumas et al., 2023, pp. 17–18). In preclinical primate models, treatment with pegcetacoplan reduced drusen-like deposits and normalized cytokine profiles within the RPE, suggesting that the drug can restore the phagocytic and immunoregulatory functions of the RPE (Buonfiglio et al., 2024, pp. 15–17; Cruz-Pimentel & Wu, 2023, pp. 3–4). Clinically, phase II and III trials (FILLY, DERBY, OAKS) have provided corroborative evidence by showing that pegcetacoplan slowed the progression of geographic atrophy, as measured by reduced enlargement of GA lesion size over time (Halawa et al., 2021, pp. 2–4; Qin et al., 2024, pp. 3–5). Although improvements in visual acuity are modest or not directly evident, the preservation of retinal structure and the slowed progression of atrophy are considered meaningful outcomes in a disease currently lacking robust treatment options (Dascalu et al., 2024, pp. 23–24; Tzoumas et al., 2023, pp. 5–6). At the cellular level, markers for RPE function—such as the maintenance of phagocytic activity and cytokine balance—are expected to improve with effective complement inhibition, thereby slowing disease progression and potentially preserving the quality of life for patients with dry AMD. Furthermore, expression data confirm that complement components, including C3, are highly expressed in the RPE and surrounding tissues, supporting the rationale that modulating these signals can have direct cellular benefits (Halawa et al., 2021, pp. 1–2; Wong & Kwok, 2022, pp. 1–2).

Overall Evaluation:
Pegcetacoplan offers a mechanistically precise therapeutic strategy for addressing dry AMD by directly modulating the complement system, a central player in the disease’s pathogenesis. One of its major strengths is its high target specificity, which is achieved through the cyclic compstatin structure and further enhanced by PEGylation, leading to improved pharmacokinetics and a favorable dosing regimen that is compatible with intravitreal administration (Lamers et al., 2022, pp. 4–6; Ong et al., 2024, pp. 16–17). The extensive preclinical rationale—that inhibition of C3 activity can reduce inflammatory cytokine production, diminish drusen biogenesis, and restore RPE phagocytic function—is strongly supported by both biochemical and animal studies (Cruz-Pimentel & Wu, 2023, pp. 1–3; Patel et al., 2022, pp. 6–7). Clinically, the FILLY, DERBY, and OAKS trials have provided robust evidence that pegcetacoplan slows the progression of geographic atrophy; this anatomical preservation is a clinically meaningful endpoint in a population with no approved treatments for dry AMD (Antonio-Aguirre & Arevalo, 2023, pp. 4–7; Ong et al., 2024, pp. 17–19). Additionally, the favorable safety profile observed in these trials, even with the known potential risk of conversion to neovascular AMD, supports its continued evaluation and possible selection as a front-runner in the treatment of dry AMD (Tzoumas et al., 2023, pp. 31–32; Halawa et al., 2021, pp. 4–6).

Nonetheless, several challenges and weaknesses remain. A critical concern is the reported risk of adverse events such as new-onset choroidal neovascularization (CNV), which has been noted to occur at a higher frequency in treated groups compared to sham controls. Although this risk appears to be manageable with adjunctive anti-VEGF therapy, it raises questions about the long-term safety of complete complement inhibition and whether a partial rather than full blockade of C3 might be more appropriate (Tzoumas et al., 2023, pp. 32–33; Buonfiglio et al., 2024, pp. 15–17). In addition, while anatomical endpoints such as reduced GA lesion growth are promising, the translation of these benefits into meaningful functional improvements (for instance, in best-corrected visual acuity or low-luminance visual acuity) remains less clear, necessitating longer term studies and potentially more sensitive functional assessments (Qin et al., 2024, pp. 3–5; Guimaraes et al., 2022, p. 7). There is also the broader question of dosing frequency and patient selection; optimizing the treatment regimen to maximize therapeutic benefit while minimizing risk, especially in genetically heterogeneous populations, will be essential for the long-term success of the candidate (Patel et al., 2022, pp. 7–9; Tzoumas et al., 2023, pp. 5–6). Furthermore, the interplay between complement inhibition and the complex immune milieu of the retina is not entirely understood, and complete suppression of complement activity could theoretically impair host defense mechanisms in ocular tissues (Wong & Kwok, 2022, pp. 1–2; Wilke & Apte, 2024, pp. 7–8).

Overall, based on the comprehensive review of biomedical, clinical, and biochemical literature, pegcetacoplan shows strong potential as a therapeutic candidate for dry AMD. Its mechanism of directly targeting complement C3 addresses a well-validated aspect of AMD pathogenesis, with clinical trial data providing robust evidence for slowing GA progression. The strengths of pegcetacoplan reside in its high specificity, favorable pharmacokinetics due to PEGylation, and the solid translational evidence from preclinical and clinical studies. However, the candidate is not without its weaknesses: concerns regarding the risk of CNV, the need for regular intravitreal injections, and the limited demonstrated functional visual improvement must be carefully weighed. Despite these challenges, the mechanistic rationale, combined with clinical efficacy in reducing anatomical progression of GA, supports continued investment in pegcetacoplan for dry AMD. With careful patient stratification, optimized dosing regimens, and vigilant safety monitoring, pegcetacoplan represents one of the most promising approaches to address an area of high unmet medical need in ophthalmology (Lamers et al., 2022, pp. 7–9; Cruz-Pimentel & Wu, 2023, pp. 4–6; Patel et al., 2022, pp. 7–9).
