Proposal for Dapansutrile (OLT1177; Ifm Tre)

Below is our comprehensive evaluation report for Dapansutrile (OLT1177) as a repurposed candidate for treating dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD):

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Dapansutrile is an orally bioavailable small‐molecule inhibitor that belongs to the class of beta‐sulfonyl nitrile compounds; it was originally discovered and developed by Olatec Therapeutics for its potent anti‐inflammatory properties. Its chemical structure and affinity for the NLRP3 inflammasome place it in a group of selective inhibitors that work by interfering with the ATPase activity of NLRP3, thereby preventing its oligomerization and subsequent activation. Being a synthetic compound, dapansutrile has been optimized for oral administration and systemic bioavailability, which is a key advantage over locally administered therapies. This class of therapeutic compounds has been previously applied in systemic inflammatory diseases, showing that targeting inflammasome pathways can translate into clinical efficacy in diseases such as gout, heart failure, and Schnitzler’s syndrome. Its development builds on a growing body of research that has demonstrated the central role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in mediating chronic sterile inflammation across different tissues (Singh, 2025; Tanase et al., 2023).

Therapeutic History:
Dapansutrile’s therapeutic history is notable for its evaluation in several non‐ocular inflammatory disease settings. Early Phase I trials in healthy volunteers (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2014) demonstrated that dapansutrile is safe and well‐tolerated when administered orally with predictable pharmacokinetics. Subsequently, clinical studies such as the Phase 2a proof‐of‐concept trial in acute gout flares (Jansen et al., 2019; Klück et al., 2020) have provided evidence that oral dosing of dapansutrile results in significant reductions in joint pain and inflammatory cytokine levels, particularly interleukin‐1β (IL-1β) and IL-6, with minimal adverse effects. Additionally, it has been studied in conditions such as Schnitzler’s syndrome (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018a) and heart failure (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018b), where its inhibitory effect on the NLRP3 inflammasome was central to its clinical activity. Although there is as yet no direct clinical trial data for dapansutrile in treating dry AMD or closely related ocular inflammatory conditions, the molecule’s clinical success in diverse inflammatory diseases provides a strong rationale for repurposing it for a condition characterized by chronic retinal inflammation (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Mechanism of Action:
Dapansutrile works by selectively inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome, an intracellular multiprotein complex that, when activated, converts pro-caspase-1 into active caspase-1. Caspase-1 then cleaves the inactive precursors of IL-1β and IL-18 into their mature, bioactive forms which are then secreted, driving a cascade of inflammatory responses. The compound achieves its effect by binding directly to the NLRP3 protein, interfering with its ATPase activity—a necessary step for the oligomerization of NLRP3 with the adaptor protein ASC, and the subsequent activation of caspase-1 (Singh, 2025; Tanase et al., 2023). By blocking this critical assembly step, dapansutrile effectively reduces the production of IL-1β and IL-18. Preclinical studies have shown that inhibition of NLRP3 activation leads to reduced inflammatory cytokine release in human monocytes and macrophages, and it does so selectively without affecting other inflammasomes (such as AIM2 or NLRC4), thereby decreasing the risk of off-target effects (Schwaid & Spencer, 2020; Mezzaroma et al., 2021). In the context of dry AMD, chronic activation of NLRP3 within retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells contributes to an inflammatory microenvironment that underlies the degeneration and dysfunction of these cells. Therefore, inhibiting NLRP3 represents a mechanistically targeted approach to reduce downstream pro-inflammatory cytokines and thereby mitigate RPE cell pyroptosis and preserve retinal homeostasis (Campbell & Doyle, 2013; Doyle et al., 2012).

Expected Effect:
Based on the underlying hypothesis, the expected effect of dapansutrile in dry AMD is fourfold. First, by inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome, the drug is anticipated to suppress the maturation and secretion of IL-1β and IL-18, cytokines critically involved in propagating a chronic inflammatory state within the retinal posterior segment. Second, the reduction in inflammatory cytokines should mitigate pyroptotic cell death in RPE cells, thereby preserving their viability and function. Third, by reducing chronic inflammation, dapansutrile is expected to indirectly restore autophagic processes and improve the phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) by the RPE. In vitro studies and animal models of AMD have demonstrated that dysregulated autophagy and impaired clearance of POS are key features of dry AMD, and that inflammation exacerbates these defects (Piippo, 2019; Wang et al., 2016). Fourth, as oral dosing of dapansutrile has been shown to produce systemic plasma levels capable of crossing the blood–retinal barrier (BRB), there is reasonable expectation that sufficient drug concentrations could reach the RPE layer, thereby exerting its anti-inflammatory effects locally (Anderson et al., 2023; Tengesdal et al., 2024). With RPE cells being a primary target in dry AMD pathology, the inhibition of inflammasome-driven cytokine production is thus anticipated to result in an overall reduction of retinal degeneration, potentially halting or even reversing the progression of geographic atrophy associated with dry AMD (Doyle et al., 2012; Campbell & Doyle, 2013).

Overall Evaluation:
Dapansutrile presents as a highly promising candidate for repurposing in dry AMD treatment, with several key strengths supporting its potential efficacy. Its oral bioavailability and favorable safety profile—demonstrated in multiple Phase I and II studies in other inflammatory conditions—provide a practical advantage for chronic systemic therapy, which is particularly valuable given the need for sustained treatment in dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2014; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018b; Klück et al., 2020). Furthermore, its precise mechanism of action, targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome and thereby reducing IL-1β and IL-18 secretion, directly addresses a pathogenic axis implicated in the progression of dry AMD. This mechanistic rationale is strengthened by literature that documents upregulated NLRP3 activation in RPE cells under oxidative stress and inflammatory conditions – key factors in AMD pathology (Campbell & Doyle, 2013; Doyle et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2016). Moreover, by potentially restoring autophagy and normal phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments, dapansutrile may correct multiple facets of the degenerative process in dry AMD.

However, there are also noteworthy limitations that must be acknowledged. As of now, there are no published ocular-specific pharmacokinetic studies confirming that orally administered dapansutrile achieves therapeutic concentrations within the retinal tissues. Although systemic plasma levels suggest the possibility of BRB penetration, definitive data on retinal bioavailability are lacking (Tengesdal et al., 2024; Mezzaroma et al., 2021). Furthermore, while the preclinical evidence strongly supports the role of NLRP3 in AMD, direct preclinical models using dapansutrile in retinal settings or animal models of dry AMD have not been extensively reported in the current literature. Without such targeted studies, the translation of its anti-inflammatory efficacy from systemic inflammatory conditions to the unique microenvironment of the retina remains an assumption that must be validated. In addition, the intricate interplay between the protective and deleterious roles of inflammasome activation in AMD (for example, the dual roles of IL-18) requires careful balancing. An overly broad suppression of NLRP3 activation could potentially interfere with protective immune mechanisms within the eye (Campbell & Doyle, 2013; Doyle et al., 2012). Lastly, while the safety in systemic administration has been documented for conditions such as gout and heart failure, the long-term safety profile for chronic use in an elderly population with dry AMD, who may additionally have comorbidities, needs to be rigorously assessed (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018b; Klück et al., 2020).

In summary, dapansutrile’s strong preclinical and clinical background as a selective NLRP3 inhibitor, its oral delivery, and promising safety data in systemic inflammatory diseases make it a compelling candidate for repurposing in dry AMD. Its proposed mechanism—suppressing inflammasome activation in the RPE, reducing IL-1β/IL-18 secretion, mitigating RPE pyroptosis, and indirectly restoring critical autophagic and phagocytic functions—addresses several key pathogenic mechanisms implicated in AMD. However, before advancing in clinical development for dry AMD, targeted investigations are required to confirm retinal penetration, efficacy in ocular inflammatory models, and the optimal dosing strategy to achieve a balance between reducing harmful inflammation while preserving necessary immune functions.

Overall, we conclude that dapansutrile represents an innovative, mechanism-based approach to treating dry AMD, and with further focused ocular studies, it holds the potential to fill a significant therapeutic gap in a patient population with limited current treatment options (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Campbell & Doyle, 2013; Doyle et al., 2012; Tanase et al., 2023; Tengesdal et al., 2024).
