Proposal for Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) is a naturally occurring bile acid derivative that belongs to the class of chemical chaperones. It is formed by the conjugation of taurine to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), a bile acid originally discovered in animal bile – historically, bear bile was used in traditional Chinese medicine. TUDCA is synthesized either via extraction from animal bile or through contemporary chemical synthesis, and its hydrophilic properties (molecular formula C26H45NO6S, molecular weight approximately 499.7) render it highly biocompatible. As a member of the bile acid family, TUDCA has been extensively studied for its cytoprotective, anti-apoptotic, and chemical chaperone activities (Kusaczuk, 2019). This class of compounds is well known for their roles in improving protein folding homeostasis, particularly by modulating the unfolded protein response (UPR) and alleviating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Its use in traditional practices coupled with modern mechanistic insights has seen TUDCA repurposed for conditions as diverse as cholestatic liver diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, and, more recently, retinal degenerative conditions (Song et al., 2024).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, TUDCA and its parent compound UDCA have been utilized in both clinical and veterinary settings for hepatic disorders, including primary biliary cholangitis and other forms of cholestasis, where they promote bile flow and protect hepatocytes from bile acid–induced apoptosis. Over the past few decades, extensive research has expanded the therapeutic applications of TUDCA to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and Huntington’s disease owing to its ability to stabilize mitochondrial function, reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and prevent apoptotic cascades in neuronal cells (Vang et al., 2014). Animal studies have provided strong evidence that TUDCA can reduce markers of ER stress and consequently diminish apoptosis. In models of retinal degeneration – including retinitis pigmentosa, retinal detachment, and other forms of retinal injury – TUDCA has been shown to protect photoreceptors and preserve retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell function. Studies using rodent models indicate that TUDCA decreases photoreceptor apoptosis and preserves overall retinal architecture (Drack et al., 2012; Alhasani et al., 2020). Although clinical trials have extensively evaluated TUDCA in hepatic and neurodegenerative conditions, there is no registered clinical study directly investigating TUDCA for dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) or related retinal degenerative diseases in humans, despite the enormous number of trials exploring bile acids in ocular applications (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Nonetheless, preclinical evidence in retinal models provides a promising rationale for its repurposing in dry AMD, where chronic ER stress and impaired autophagy are key pathological features.

Mechanism of Action:
The primary mode of action of TUDCA is its function as a chemical chaperone, where it assists in the correct folding of nascent proteins and reduces the accumulation of misfolded or aggregated proteins in the ER. Under conditions of cellular stress, the unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated, and prolonged ER stress is a well‐recognized contributor to cellular dysfunction in the retina, particularly in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in dry AMD. TUDCA has been shown to stabilize protein conformation and downregulate key UPR markers such as BiP (Binding immunoglobulin Protein) and CHOP (C/EBP Homologous Protein), which are mediators of ER stress-induced apoptosis (Kusaczuk, 2019; Alhasani et al., 2020). By modulating these stress response pathways, TUDCA restores proteostasis, thereby promoting cell survival.

Beyond its role in alleviating ER stress, TUDCA has been documented to enhance autophagic flux. The autophagy-lysosome pathway is critical for the clearance of damaged organelles and aggregated proteins, including the photoreceptor outer segments (POS) that accumulate in RPE cells in dry AMD. TUDCA is proposed to upregulate the expression of lysosome-associated genes via activation of transcription factors such as ATF6, leading to increased levels of autophagy markers like LC3-II. Experimental evidence demonstrates that in primary AMD RPE cultures, treatment with 100 μM TUDCA leads to a significant reduction in CHOP expression (approximately 60% reduction) and a twofold increase in LC3-II levels as well as an improvement in FITC-POS phagocytosis by 35% (Alhasani et al., 2020). Such modulation of the autophagy-lysosome pathway is crucial for effective degradation of POS and may mitigate the lipofuscin accumulation seen in dry AMD. Additionally, TUDCA’s impact on mitochondrial stabilization is also notable; it mitigates apoptosis by preventing mitochondrial depolarization, Bax translocation, ROS generation, and cytochrome c release, further contributing to its overall cytoprotective profile (Vang et al., 2014; Boatright et al., 2019).

At the molecular level, TUDCA interacts with several cellular receptors. It has been reported to bind to nuclear steroid receptors (NSRs), facilitating their dissociation from heat shock proteins and subsequent nuclear translocation, where they can modulate gene expression related to apoptosis (Vang et al., 2014). Furthermore, it may interact with G protein-coupled bile acid receptor TGR5 (GPBAR1), which is expressed in retinal ganglion cells and possibly in RPE cells, to mediate anti-inflammatory responses via increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. Such receptor-mediated actions add another dimension to its neuroprotective effects by reducing inflammation in the retinal microenvironment.

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis under evaluation is that TUDCA will alleviate ER stress in RPE cells, restore proteostasis, and enhance the function of the autophagy-lysosome pathway to improve the clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) in dry AMD. In vitro assays using primary AMD RPE cultures have preliminarily shown that treatment with TUDCA at a concentration of 100 μM results in a marked reduction in ER stress marker CHOP by 60% and an increase in LC3-II by 2-fold, which correlates with improved phagocytosis of FITC-labeled POS by 35% (Alhasani et al., 2020). This suggests that TUDCA enhances the degradative capacity of RPE cells, which is pivotal because impaired POS clearance is believed to contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of dry AMD through accumulation of toxic protein aggregates and subsequent RPE dysfunction.

On the molecular side, the expected beneficial effects are supported by TUDCA’s documented ability to stabilize protein folding and reduce unfolded protein response (UPR) activation, which in turn alleviates chronic ER stress—a key factor driving lysosomal dysfunction in RPE cells (Kusaczuk, 2019; Boatright et al., 2019). Additionally, by promoting autophagic flux, TUDCA is expected to improve the turnover and clearance of damaged proteins and organelles, thereby restoring cellular homeostasis. This is critical for maintaining photoreceptor health because the RPE not only serves as a support cell layer that provides metabolic and phagocytic support to photoreceptors but also plays a crucial role in preventing toxic build-up within the retinal environment. Expression profiling in RPE cells confirms that key autophagy genes and UPR-related genes, such as ATF6, BiP, and CHOP, are modulated under stress conditions, and TUDCA’s action appears to impact these pathways beneficially (Alhasani et al., 2020; Boatright et al., 2019).

Furthermore, animal models of retinal degeneration have shown that systemic administration of TUDCA decreases the apoptotic indices in photoreceptors, leading to preservation of the outer nuclear layer (ONL) and overall retinal architecture (Drack et al., 2012; Boatright et al., 2019). The expected effect in dry AMD would similarly be a reduction in photoreceptor loss, maintained RPE structure, and overall improved visual function over time. Because dry AMD is characterized by gradual degeneration of photoreceptors and RPE cells due in part to impaired clearance mechanisms, a compound such as TUDCA that can directly modulate these cellular processes is highly relevant.

Overall Evaluation:
TUDCA emerges as an attractive and mechanism-specific therapeutic candidate for dry AMD based on its multifaceted actions that directly address key pathophysiological mechanisms implicated in the disease. One major strength of TUDCA is its dual action as a chemical chaperone and modulator of the autophagy-lysosome pathway, which positions it to alleviate chronic ER stress and restore normal protein homeostasis in RPE cells. Preclinical studies have robustly demonstrated that TUDCA reduces ER stress markers (notably CHOP) and enhances autophagic flux (as evidenced by increased LC3-II levels), leading to improved clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (Alhasani et al., 2020). These mechanistic actions are particularly promising in the context of dry AMD, where lipofuscin accumulation and other byproducts of impaired degradation pathways are central to disease progression. Moreover, TUDCA’s previously documented safety profile in hepatic and neurodegenerative studies represents a substantial advantage when considering repurposing for ocular indications; safety is especially critical in chronic diseases such as dry AMD where long-term treatment would be necessary.

However, there are also weaknesses and challenges to consider. Although extensive preclinical data in animal models support TUDCA’s cytoprotective effects, direct clinical evidence in patients with dry AMD is currently lacking. The large number of clinical trials involving TUDCA in other indications (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.) underscores the interest in bile acid therapeutics, yet the translation of these findings to the specific context of dry AMD remains to be fully validated. Another potential weakness is the need to establish optimal dosing and ocular pharmacokinetics specifically in the retina. While in vitro studies in primary RPE cultures have shown promising effects at 100 μM, it is essential to determine whether similar concentrations can be achieved in vivo in the retina without adverse effects. Furthermore, while TUDCA is known to modulate ER stress and autophagy pathways, these processes are inherently complex and may vary significantly between model systems and human pathology. Therefore, further validation in translational models that closely mimic human dry AMD is imperative.

In summary, the strengths of TUDCA lie in its well-characterized mechanism of enhancing proteostasis by reducing ER stress and promoting autophagic clearance, its proven neuroprotective effects in retinal and other neurodegenerative models, and its established safety profile in clinical studies for other diseases (Vang et al., 2014; Drack et al., 2012). These attributes strongly support its potential as a repurposed therapeutic agent for dry AMD, where RPE dysfunction due to chronic ER stress and impaired clearance of photoreceptor outer segments is a key pathological feature. On the other hand, the lack of direct clinical data in dry AMD patients, uncertainties regarding appropriate dosing for ocular delivery, and the complexity of the underlying disease mechanisms are challenges that must be addressed in future research. Overall, TUDCA represents a promising candidate that merits further investigation in focused preclinical studies and early-phase clinical trials to determine its efficacy in rescuing RPE clearance capacity and preserving retinal structure and function in dry AMD patients (Kusaczuk, 2019; Alhasani et al., 2020; Drack et al., 2012; Vang et al., 2014).
