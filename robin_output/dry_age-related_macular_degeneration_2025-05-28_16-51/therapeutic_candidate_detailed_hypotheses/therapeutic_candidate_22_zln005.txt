Proposal for ZLN005 (PGC-1α transcriptional activator; MedChemExpress Cat# HY-12491)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
ZLN005 is a small-molecule synthetic compound originally identified through small-molecule screening programs designed to activate the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha). As a selective pharmaceutical inducer of PGC-1α, ZLN005 belongs to the class of compounds that modulate gene transcription to enhance mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism. Its discovery was initially reported in contexts involving skeletal muscle metabolism, where it was shown to robustly upregulate both PGC-1α mRNA and protein levels, thereby stimulating mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation gene networks. More recently, its utility has been explored in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells—in particular, the ARPE-19 cell line—to examine its potential protective effects against oxidative stress implicated in dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (Satish et al., 2018, pp. 1–2). ZLN005 has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile, including oral bioavailability, which is significant for repurposing efforts because such properties can facilitate rapid clinical translation relative to compounds that require invasive delivery methods. As a member of the transcriptional activator class, compounds like ZLN005 have been used in metabolic research to enhance mitochondrial capacity and antioxidant defenses, and the current interest lies in repurposing these benefits for RPE cell health in the context of AMD (Satish et al., 2018, pp. 1–2; Miller et al., 2019, pp. 2–4).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, ZLN005 emerged from research aimed primarily at addressing metabolic dysfunction observed in conditions such as diabetes and cardiomyopathy. Studies in skeletal muscle and cardiac cells demonstrated that ZLN005 effectively increases PGC-1α expression, thereby driving mitochondrial biogenesis and improving energy metabolism in preclinical models. Although its initial application was not in ocular diseases, more recent investigations have applied ZLN005 to ARPE-19 cells—a commonly used in vitro model of human retinal pigment epithelium—to assess its potential in counteracting oxidative stress-induced cell damage associated with dry AMD (Satish et al., 2018, pp. 5–6). To date, no clinical trials or veterinary applications have evaluated ZLN005 specifically for dry AMD, nor have there been studies in animal models of the disease that are widely reported in the literature; however, its ability to upregulate PGC-1α in vitro, along with its protective effects against exposure to hydrogen peroxide, oxidized LDL, and sodium iodate (oxidative stressors relevant to AMD), provides a rationale for further preclinical exploration (Satish et al., 2018, pp. 7–8; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Similar strategies have been used in other studies where enhancement of mitochondrial function and antioxidant defenses in RPE cells was therapeutic in models of dry AMD, and PGC-1α itself has been shown to regulate lysosomal enzyme gene networks as well as phagocytic processes (Tong et al., 2022, pp. 14–16).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, ZLN005 operates by selectively upregulating the expression of PGC-1α, a key transcriptional coactivator that orchestrates mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant gene expression. In ARPE-19 cells subjected to ZLN005 treatment, studies have documented a 10‐μM dose over 48 hours that produces significant increases in both PGC-1α mRNA and protein levels; this upregulation fosters the expression of downstream mitochondrial biogenesis genes such as TFAM (mitochondrial transcription factor A), MFN1 (mitofusin 1), and POLG (mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma) (Satish et al., 2018, pp. 2–4). In addition, ZLN005 treatment enhances the expression of RPE-specific genes (for instance, BEST1 and RLBP1) as well as genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, including ATP50, COX4, and NDUFB5, thereby improving oxidative respiration capacity as measured by increased basal, maximal, and spare respiratory rates. A crucial aspect of ZLN005’s mechanism includes the subsequent elevation of antioxidant enzymes—such as SOD1, SOD2, and TXN2—which serve to decrease mitochondrial superoxide production and reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. The resulting reduction in oxidative stress is critical because high ROS levels negatively impact various cellular functions, including MerTK signaling, which is central to the phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) by RPE cells (Satish et al., 2018, pp. 6–7; Tong et al., 2022, pp. 14–16). Although the precise biochemical interactions include the modulation of upstream regulators such as AMP-kinase and SIRT1—which are known to further potentiate the activity of PGC-1α—the central mode of action remains the transcriptional activation of PGC-1α and its gene networks that govern mitochondrial and lysosomal enzyme expression (Miller et al., 2019, pp. 2–4). By enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis and function, ZLN005 indirectly supports lysosomal activity since the energetic demands of lysosomal clearance and phagocytosis are tightly coupled to mitochondrial capacity. Additionally, improved mitochondrial function contributes to maintaining MerTK-mediated signaling pathways that facilitate the clearance of POS, thereby potentially improving overall RPE cellular homeostasis (Satish et al., 2018, pp. 7–8; Tong et al., 2022, pp. 14–16).

Expected Effect:
In the specific context of dry AMD, the hypothesis is that ZLN005 will lead to a multifaceted improvement in RPE cell health by directly upregulating PGC-1α. In the proposed cell-based assays using ARPE-19 and human RPE cells, ZLN005 is expected to produce a measurable increase in PGC-1α expression, accompanied by a coordinated upregulation of mitochondrial biogenesis markers such as TFAM, MFN1, and POLG—all of which are critical for generating functionally competent mitochondria at a time when RPE cells suffer from mitochondrial dysfunction due to aging and oxidative stress (Satish et al., 2018, pp. 2–4). This enhancement of mitochondrial mass and function is expected to elevate cellular ATP production and improve oxidative phosphorylation, thereby reducing the intracellular burden of ROS. Lower ROS levels, in turn, would lead to decreased oxidative modifications of proteins and lipids that otherwise impair signaling pathways such as those mediated by MerTK. MerTK signaling is responsible for the phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments, a process that is compromised in dry AMD, and restoration of this pathway through improved mitochondrial health is anticipated to enhance POS digestion and clearance (Tong et al., 2022, pp. 14–16). Additionally, the activation of PGC-1α is predicted to upregulate lysosomal enzyme expression, including factors such as LAMP2, which are critical for maintaining lysosomal integrity and function. By preventing the accumulation of lipofuscin granules and improving overall lysosomal clearance, ZLN005 supports the recycling and degradation functions of RPE cells, further contributing to the restoration of retinal homeostasis (Satish et al., 2018, pp. 8–9). The expected cumulative effect is that, by improving mitochondrial and lysosomal function through PGC-1α activation, ZLN005 will mitigate the pathological cascade seen in dry AMD—where chronic oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impaired phagocytosis converge to drive retinal degeneration (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Overall Evaluation:
The potential of ZLN005 as a therapeutic candidate for dry AMD is supported by several compelling lines of evidence. Its primary strength lies in its capacity to activate PGC-1α, a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant defense, thereby directly addressing key pathological features of AMD. The ability of ZLN005 to enhance mitochondrial respiration, increase ATP production, and upregulate the expression of critical mitochondrial and lysosomal genes in ARPE-19 cells presents a robust biological rationale for its efficacy (Satish et al., 2018, pp. 5–6; Satish et al., 2018, pp. 7–8). These mechanisms are particularly relevant given that mitochondrial dysfunction and elevated ROS levels are central drivers of RPE degeneration in dry AMD. Furthermore, the compound’s favorable pharmacokinetic properties and oral bioavailability make it an attractive candidate for rapid repurposing compared to many experimental therapeutics that require more invasive modes of administration (Miller et al., 2019, pp. 2–4).

However, several weaknesses and uncertainties warrant consideration. The majority of the supportive evidence for ZLN005's efficacy comes from in vitro studies using the ARPE-19 cell line, and while these models are highly informative for mechanistic investigation, they do not fully recapitulate the complexities of the aging human retina and dry AMD pathology. There are as yet no robust animal model data or clinical trial results directly assessing the efficacy of ZLN005 in the setting of dry AMD; thus, its translation from cell culture to a whole-organism context remains speculative (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In addition, while activation of PGC-1α is theorized to improve lysosomal enzyme expression and aid in phagocytosis via MerTK signaling, direct evidence linking ZLN005-mediated PGC-1α upregulation to enhanced POS digestion has not been conclusively demonstrated in the current literature. There is also an inherent risk of off-target effects or excessive activation of mitochondrial biogenesis pathways, which in some contexts can lead to cellular stress or even cell death if not properly regulated (Satish et al., 2018, pp. 1–2; Satish et al., 2018, pp. 7–8).

In conclusion, ZLN005 represents a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry AMD based on its ability to modulate PGC-1α and thereby enhance mitochondrial and lysosomal function. The comprehensive literature supports that mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and impaired phagocytosis are central to RPE degeneration in dry AMD, and that pharmacologically restoring mitochondrial biogenesis may ameliorate these defects. Strengths of ZLN005 include its specific activation of a critical transcriptional regulator, favorable pharmacokinetics, and the preclinical data suggesting protection against oxidative insults. Nonetheless, further research is needed—particularly in animal models and clinical trials—to evaluate whether these in vitro benefits translate into meaningful therapeutic outcomes in patients with dry AMD. The next steps should include detailed in vivo studies to assess the impact of ZLN005 on mitochondrial function, lysosomal enzyme levels, ROS reduction, and ultimately on phagocytic clearance through MerTK signaling in a model that closely mimics dry AMD pathology (Tong et al., 2022, pp. 14–16; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).
