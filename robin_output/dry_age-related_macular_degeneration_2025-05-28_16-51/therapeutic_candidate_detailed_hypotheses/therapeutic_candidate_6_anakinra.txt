Proposal for Anakinra (Kineret; Swedish Orphan Biovitrum)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Anakinra (Kineret; Swedish Orphan Biovitrum) is a recombinant protein consisting of the naturally occurring interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), a molecule originally discovered as a regulator of the excessive inflammatory effects of interleukin-1 (IL-1). It is produced through recombinant DNA technology in bacterial or mammalian cell expression systems so that the resulting protein mimics the endogenous IL-1 receptor antagonist, thereby competitively inhibiting the binding of IL-1 alpha (IL-1α) and IL-1 beta (IL-1β) to the IL-1 receptor (IL-1R1). This class of biologics, the IL-1 inhibitors, is widely used in inflammatory diseases. In its approved application for rheumatoid arthritis, for example, Anakinra has demonstrated significant efficacy by dampening the inflammation mediated by aberrant IL-1 signaling – a mechanistic principle that can be extended to other diseases in which IL-1 is implicated, such as various autoinflammatory disorders and possibly ocular inflammatory conditions (Fabiani et al., 2017, pp. 1–2). Given its relatively small protein size, Anakinra is anticipated to achieve favorable ocular tissue diffusion when delivered intravitreally or periocularly; this potential is particularly attractive for achieving local effects in the retina.

Therapeutic History:
Anakinra was initially developed to address the dysregulated IL-1–mediated inflammation seen in rheumatoid arthritis and other systemic autoinflammatory conditions, such as cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS). Over the years, its safety profile has been extensively characterized during systemic administration and has shown minimal serious adverse events in these populations (Fabiani et al., 2017, pp. 1–2). In the context of ocular therapeutics, IL-1 blockade has been progressively investigated as a strategy for combating a range of inflammatory eye diseases. Preclinical studies and case reports have provided early evidence that IL-1 inhibitors, including Anakinra, may reduce ocular inflammation such as uveitis, scleritis, and even dry eye disease. For example, in experimental models of laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV), intravitreal Anakinra administered in a dose-dependent fashion resulted in reductions in the neovascular area, demonstrating anti-inflammatory and antiangiogenic effects that are indirectly relevant to the pathogenesis of retinal degenerative diseases (Fabiani et al., 2017, pp. 2–3; Campbell & Doyle, 2013, pp. 7–8). Although Anakinra has not been directly trialed in clinical studies for dry age-related macular degeneration (dry AMD), its repurposing for other ocular inflammatory conditions supports the plausibility of its use in diseases that share overlapping inflammatory mechanisms. Additional supportive evidence comes from preclinical studies that link IL-1β—generated downstream of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells—to chronic inflammation and cellular dysfunction in AMD (Brandstetter, 2016, pp. 102–104; Tseng, 2014, pp. 90–94). These studies imply that modulating IL-1-dependent pathways could be beneficial in preserving RPE function and retinal homeostasis in AMD.

Mechanism of Action:
On a molecular level, Anakinra exerts its therapeutic effect by competitively binding to the IL-1 receptor type 1 (IL-1R1), thereby blocking the interaction of both IL-1α and IL-1β with this receptor. Under normal conditions, activation of IL-1R1 by IL-1β leads to a cascade of intracellular signaling events, including the activation of NF-κB and the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, that ultimately upregulate proinflammatory gene transcription. In dry AMD, there is increasing evidence that local factors, including oxidative stress, lipofuscin accumulation, and drusen components, activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in RPE cells; this inflammasome activation results in caspase-1–mediated cleavage of pro-IL-1β into its active form (Brandstetter, 2016, pp. 102–104; Tseng, 2014, pp. 94–99). The released IL-1β, in turn, fuels a local proinflammatory environment that perpetuates RPE dysfunction, impairs autophagic and lysosomal clearance mechanisms, and disrupts the integrin/MerTK-mediated phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments (POS). Inhibiting IL-1 signaling with Anakinra would therefore theoretically interrupt this self-amplifying cascade. By binding to IL-1 receptors, Anakinra prevents IL-1β from triggering downstream inflammatory pathways such as those leading to the secretion of other proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6, IL-8) and chemokines, cytokines that are known to mediate immune cell recruitment and further tissue damage in the retina (Tan et al., 2020, pp. 4–5; Fabiani et al., 2017, pp. 10–11). On a more detailed biochemical level, blocking IL-1R1 also allows for the stabilization of autophagic function in the RPE, which is essential for the clearance of cellular debris and for maintaining the health of photoreceptors. Preservation of autophagy and lysosomal activity in RPE cells directly supports the capacity for effective POS phagocytosis – a critical function compromised in AMD. Additionally, by mitigating IL-1 signaling, Anakinra may indirectly support normal cytoskeletal dynamics and integrin-mediated cell adhesion processes required for efficient phagocytosis via MerTK receptors located on the RPE (Korhonen, 2024, pp. 168–171).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis for repurposing Anakinra in dry AMD posits that intravitreal or periocular administration of this IL-1 receptor antagonist will reduce the local retinal inflammation induced by NLRP3 inflammasome activation in RPE cells. Specifically, by preventing IL-1β from engaging its receptor, Anakinra is expected to reduce the secretion of downstream inflammatory mediators that exacerbate RPE cell stress and promote cell death through pyroptosis. As RPE cells are pivotal in maintaining the health of the retinal environment—by phagocytosing shed POS and by managing oxidative stress—the attenuation of chronic inflammation should help preserve cellular autophagic functions and lysosomal homeostasis. This preservation would, in turn, support the integrin/MerTK-mediated clearance of dysfunctional POS, thereby potentially slowing the progression of dry AMD. Preclinical evidence suggests that IL-1β levels are elevated in the vitreous and RPE of AMD patients, with inflammasome products correlating with disease severity (Tseng, 2014, pp. 90–94; Korhonen, 2024, pp. 84–86). Additional studies have shown that inhibiting IL-1 signaling in ocular experimental models leads to decreased choroidal neovascularization and preserved retinal structure (Campbell & Doyle, 2013, pp. 7–8; Fabiani et al., 2017, pp. 2–3). In assays designed to evaluate retinal inflammatory status and phagocytic function of RPE cells, one would expect to observe reduced levels of IL-1β, decreased markers of inflammasome activation (e.g., caspase-1 cleavage), and normalized expression or activity of phagocytic receptors like MerTK. Furthermore, restoration of autophagy markers and cytoskeletal dynamics in the RPE would provide biochemical evidence of improved cellular homeostasis and function (Brandstetter, 2016, pp. 102–104; Korhonen, 2024, pp. 168–171). Given that Anakinra is a small protein molecule, its intraocular diffusion following local injection is expected to be sufficient to reach the RPE layer in therapeutic concentrations, thereby ensuring effective receptor blockade in the targeted tissue (Fabiani et al., 2017, pp. 10–11; Tan et al., 2020, pp. 4–5).

Overall Evaluation:
The repurposing of Anakinra as a candidate for treating dry age-related macular degeneration is supported by several compelling lines of evidence. One significant strength is the robust molecular rationale: IL-1β produced via NLRP3 inflammasome activation in RPE cells has been demonstrated to initiate and perpetuate a chronic inflammatory state that undermines lysosomal and autophagic processes—and ultimately POS phagocytosis—in the retina. By selectively blocking IL-1 receptor signaling, Anakinra could break this inflammatory cycle, offering both neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects. Preclinical studies in ocular disease models have shown that IL-1 blockade can reduce markers of inflammation and, in some models, decrease pathological neovascularization (Fabiani et al., 2017, pp. 2–3; Campbell & Doyle, 2013, pp. 7–8). Moreover, the extensive clinical experience with Anakinra in systemic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, which has established a favorable safety profile, accelerates its potential repositioning for ocular indications (Fabiani et al., 2017, pp. 1–2).

However, several weaknesses and challenges remain. To date, there is a paucity of direct clinical trial evidence supporting the use of Anakinra in dry AMD specifically; most of the available data pertain to its effects in other ocular inflammatory conditions such as uveitis or, in the context of CNV models, in neovascular AMD (Campbell & Doyle, 2013, pp. 7–8; Tseng, 2014, pp. 94–99). This gap indicates a key area where further preclinical and clinical studies are needed. Additionally, the pharmacokinetic profile of Anakinra poses challenges regarding its ability to maintain therapeutic concentrations in the posterior segment of the eye. Its relatively short half-life might require repeated intravitreal or periocular injections, which raises concerns about patient compliance and the cumulative risk of injection-related complications such as endophthalmitis. Although preclinical studies have reported safety following intravitreal administration, detailed pharmacodynamic and long-term safety evaluations specific to the ocular environment remain to be conducted (Fabiani et al., 2017, pp. 10–11; Tseng, 2014, pp. 90–94).

Another potential limitation lies in the complexity of the inflammatory milieu within AMD. The pathogenesis of dry AMD is multifactorial, involving not only IL-1β but also other cytokines such as IL-18, complement activation products, and reactive oxygen species. While IL-1β blockade may alleviate one aspect of the pathological cascade, it does not address the entirety of the degenerative process. For instance, IL-18 has been implicated in both protective and detrimental roles in AMD, and its regulation is not directly affected by IL-1 receptor antagonism (Brandstetter, 2016, pp. 102–104; Korhonen, 2024, pp. 84–86). Thus, the therapeutic benefit of Anakinra might be limited if other inflammatory pathways continue to drive RPE degeneration despite IL-1 blockade.

In summary, the overall evaluation of Anakinra as a repurposed therapy for dry AMD is cautiously optimistic. The drug’s mechanism of action directly targets a key inflammatory cascade—that is, IL-1β signaling—that has been extensively implicated in RPE dysfunction and retinal degeneration. Its established safety profile in systemic use and preliminary supportive data in ocular models lend further credence to its potential. However, the translation of these findings to the treatment of dry AMD will require robust preclinical studies focusing on pharmacokinetics, efficacy in models that mimic the chronic degenerative nature of dry AMD, and eventually, well-designed clinical trials to assess both safety and therapeutic benefit in patients. The complex interplay of multiple inflammatory mediators in AMD also suggests that combination therapies or broader anti-inflammatory strategies may be needed in parallel to IL-1 blockade. Overall, while Anakinra presents as a promising candidate with considerable mechanistic rationale and supportive preclinical evidence, strategic further investigation is warranted to comprehensively determine its viability as a treatment for dry AMD (Fabiani et al., 2017, pp. 1–2; Tan et al., 2020, pp. 4–5; Tseng, 2014, pp. 94–99; Korhonen, 2024, pp. 168–171).
