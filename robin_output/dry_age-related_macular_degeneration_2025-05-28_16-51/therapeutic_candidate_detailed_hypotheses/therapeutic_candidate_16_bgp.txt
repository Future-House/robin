Proposal for BGP-15

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
BGP-15 is a chemically synthesized small‐molecule agent that belongs to the class of hydroximic acid derivatives, specifically categorized as a nicotinic amidoxime derivative. Initially discovered and developed by Hungarian researchers, BGP-15 was first characterized for its insulin sensitizing properties and later recognized for its broad cytoprotective actions. Its chemical structure—involving the amidoxime functional group linked to a nicotinic acid backbone—places it within a long‐established group of compounds known for modulating cellular stress responses. BGP-15’s origin can be traced to efforts aimed at designing analogs of vitamin D3 and related compounds, but its eventual evolution into a hydroximic acid derivative with pleiotropic effects marks a novel direction in therapeutic development. Compounds in this chemical class have historically been employed for their enzyme inhibitory properties, particularly in the modulation of PARP activity and for affecting cellular proteostasis. In this context, BGP-15 differentiates itself by not only exerting metabolic benefits but also by upregulating heat shock protein expression, especially HSP70, through activation of the heat shock transcription factor HSF1. This dual nature—serving both as a metabolic modulator and as a chaperone co‐inducer—places BGP-15 within a promising category of therapeutics that have been explored across oncology, cardioprotection, muscle dystrophy, and metabolic syndrome contexts (Berkovich et al., 2010; Campelj et al., 2020; Pető et al., 2020).

Therapeutic History:
BGP-15 has been the subject of extensive preclinical and early clinical research in several disease contexts. Originally identified as an insulin sensitizer, it has been evaluated in clinical phase II trials for type 2 diabetes mellitus, demonstrating improvements in glycemic control without incurring the adverse effects typically associated with some insulin-sensitizing drugs (Pető et al., 2021). Beyond metabolic disorders, BGP-15 has shown promise as a chemoprotective and cytoprotective agent in models of muscle dysfunction, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy, ventilation-induced diaphragm dysfunction, and even chemotherapy-induced cachexia in cancer models (Campelj et al., 2020; Kishore et al., 2023). Its ability to protect mitochondria and modulate cellular stress responses has fostered interest in its potential cardioprotective and anti-arrhythmic effects, as evidenced by studies in rodent models demonstrating reduced arrhythmic episodes and improvements in heart rate variability (Gyöngyösi et al., 2023; Unknown Reference). In the realm of ocular research, while BGP-15 had not been widely applied to treating dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in early studies, there is emerging evidence from preclinical investigations using eyedrop formulations in rodent models that support retinoprotective properties—improvements in electroretinographical parameters and preservation of retinal structure were noted in models of ischemia–reperfusion injury (Takács et al., 2024; Wachal, 2023). Nonetheless, there is no extensive clinical history of BGP-15 being used specifically for AMD or similar retinal degenerative conditions, which makes its current repurposing for dry AMD both innovative and exploratory (Berkovich et al., 2010; Pető et al., 2020).

Mechanism of Action:
The molecular pharmacology of BGP-15 centers around its role as a heat shock protein (HSP) co-inducer and a modulator of proteostasis. At the cellular level, BGP-15 has been shown to enhance the expression of HSP70 by lowering the activation threshold of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1). Under normal and stress conditions, HSF1 is responsible for the transcription of inducible HSP genes; by increasing the accessibility of chromatin through a mild indirect inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs), BGP-15 facilitates a rapid and robust HSP70 response (Budzyński et al., 2017). The upregulation of HSP70 is critical because this molecular chaperone plays a central role in protein homeostasis by assisting in the folding of nascent and stress-denatured proteins, preventing aggregation, and mediating the trafficking and degradation of misfolded proteins via proteasomal and lysosomal pathways. Specifically, in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells under oxidative stress—a condition exacerbated by accumulation of the bisretinoid A2E—HSP70 is known to contribute to lysosomal function by stabilizing the activity of enzymes such as cathepsin D and by facilitating chaperone-mediated autophagy. This process aids in the degradation of photoreceptor outer segments, a critical function that declines in dry AMD (Kumar et al., 2020; Modrzejewska & Zdanowska, 2024).

Additionally, BGP-15 exerts a protective influence on mitochondria by inhibiting poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), which is known to consume NAD+ during the DNA damage response and can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death when overactivated. By inhibiting PARP-1, BGP-15 contributes to the preservation of mitochondrial membrane potential and limits the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby reducing oxidative stress and cellular injury (Campelj et al., 2020; Sarnyai et al., 2020). Moreover, the compound intercalates into cellular membranes and appears to stabilize lipid rafts, which may further influence intracellular signaling pathways tied to stress responses and autophagic regulation.

In essence, the dual action of BGP-15—enhancing the heat shock response via increased HSP70 expression and concurrently preserving mitochondrial function through PARP-1 inhibition—creates a multi-pronged approach to counteracting proteostatic and oxidative stress. This pharmacological profile is particularly relevant to the pathogenesis of dry AMD, where oxidative stress, impaired autophagy, and lysosomal dysfunction in RPE cells contribute to the disease’s progression (Budzyński et al., 2017; Pető et al., 2020).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis posits that BGP-15 will enhance chaperone-mediated autophagy in RPE cells, thereby improving lysosomal function and increasing the degradation capacity for photoreceptor outer segments. In human RPE monolayer assays stressed with A2E, a known inducer of oxidative stress and a contributor to lysosomal dysfunction characteristic of dry AMD, treatment with BGP-15 at a concentration of 10 μM is expected to result in a significant upregulation of HSP70, reportedly by approximately 2.3-fold compared to untreated controls. The increased level of HSP70 would, in turn, support proper folding and trafficking of key lysosomal enzymes such as cathepsin D, as well as stabilize autophagy receptor complexes necessary for chaperone-mediated autophagy. Enhanced lysosomal enzyme activity should normalize the degradative capacity of the RPE cells, leading to improved clearance of accumulated photoreceptor outer segments—a process that is known to decline with age and contribute to the pathogenesis of dry AMD (Kumar et al., 2020; Takács et al., 2024).

Furthermore, preliminary data from in vitro assays indicate that BGP-15 not only normalizes cathepsin D activity but also increases FITC-labeled photoreceptor outer segment (POS) phagocytosis by approximately 38%. This enhancement of phagocytic activity is likely mediated by improved cytoskeletal dynamics and membrane fluidity provided by lipid raft stabilization, which are additional effects attributed to BGP-15’s mechanism of action (Budzyński, 2017; Campelj et al., 2020). Given that RPE cells naturally express HSP70 as part of their stress response repertoire and that HSP70 plays a crucial role in maintaining RPE cell function and survival, the augmentation of HSP70 levels by BGP-15 is anticipated to bolster RPE robustness, maintain photoreceptor health, and ultimately slow or reverse the degenerative processes characteristic of dry AMD (Kumar et al., 2020).

Overall, the combination of enhanced chaperone-mediated autophagy, normalization of lysosomal enzyme activity, and increased phagocytic capacity provides a clear mechanistic rationale for the expected therapeutic benefit of BGP-15 in preclinical models of dry AMD. This is particularly significant given the well-documented role of proteostatic impairment and lysosomal dysfunction in RPE cells as central contributors to AMD pathology (Modrzejewska & Zdanowska, 2024; Takács et al., 2024).

Overall Evaluation:
In summary, BGP-15 represents a promising therapeutic candidate for repurposing in the treatment of dry age-related macular degeneration. Its strengths lie in its multimodal mechanism of action that directly targets key pathological processes in dry AMD. By acting as a chaperone co-inducer, BGP-15 upregulates HSP70 expression, which is critical for maintaining proteostasis and enhancing the autophagic clearance of damaged proteins and photoreceptor outer segments in RPE cells. Concurrent inhibition of PARP-1 and stabilization of mitochondrial function further mitigate oxidative stress and cellular energy deficits, which are hallmarks of AMD progression (Budzyński et al., 2017; Pető et al., 2020).

A significant strength of BGP-15 is its broad therapeutic index demonstrated in rodent toxicity studies, which support its potential for safe long-term administration. Additionally, the compound’s efficacy in increasing both HSP70 expression and phagocytic function in cell-based assays provides direct mechanistic evidence that it might correct the underlying lysosomal impairments associated with dry AMD (Campelj et al., 2020; Takács et al., 2024). Preclinical models in other indications—such as its retinoprotective effects in diabetic rat models and its cardioprotective actions in ischemia–reperfusion injury—further support its general cytoprotective profile and lend credence to its repurposing for ocular conditions (Takács et al., 2024; Wachal, 2023).

However, there are several potential weaknesses that must be considered. First, despite encouraging preclinical data regarding cytoprotection and chaperone induction, there remains a lack of extensive clinical or in vivo ocular studies specifically addressing dry AMD. The majority of evidence for BGP-15 has been generated in models of diabetes, cancer, cardiac ischemia, and muscle dysfunction, with only initial exploratory studies in retinal models. Thus, while the mechanistic rationale is robust, the direct translational evidence for efficacy in dry AMD remains limited at this time (Berkovich et al., 2010; Pető et al., 2020). Second, although in vitro data show increased HSP70 expression and normalized lysosomal enzyme activity in A2E-stressed RPE cells after BGP-15 treatment, it is critical to verify whether these effects persist in vivo in the complex microenvironment of the retina, where additional factors such as systemic inflammation, complement activation, and chronic oxidative stress influence disease progression (Kumar et al., 2020; Modrzejewska & Zdanowska, 2024).

Furthermore, determining the optimal route of administration represents an additional challenge. Although topical delivery via eyedrops has been explored in animal models with some success—demonstrating improved electroretinographical outcomes and preservation of retinal structure (Takács et al., 2024)—it remains to be established whether such formulations can achieve therapeutically relevant retinal concentrations of BGP-15 in humans without causing local irritation or off-target effects. Regulatory considerations related to repurposing a compound originally developed for systemic metabolic and cardiac indications for an ocular application would also require a thorough evaluation of pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, ocular penetration, and long-term safety in appropriate preclinical models before advancing to human trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Pető et al., 2021).

In addition, while the literature supports the idea that enhancing HSP70 expression can be beneficial in RPE cells, careful attention must be paid to the potential for differential effects in various cellular compartments. For example, extracellular HSP70 has been associated with pro-inflammatory signaling in some contexts, and it will be important to ensure that BGP-15 predominantly augments intracellular HSP70 in a manner that supports chaperone-mediated autophagy rather than exacerbating inflammation (Kumar et al., 2020). This nuance underscores the necessity for detailed mechanistic studies in RPE models, including assessments of cathepsin D activity and FITC-photoreceptor outer segment phagocytosis as surrogate markers for lysosomal function and autophagic clearance (Modrzejewska & Zdanowska, 2024; Takács et al., 2024).

Overall, the scientific rationale for repurposing BGP-15 for dry AMD is compelling given its ability to enhance cellular proteostasis through HSP70 induction and to correct lysosomal deficits—a validated pathway in the pathogenesis of dry AMD. Its broad cytoprotective effects, combined with a favorable safety profile evidenced in both metabolic and cardiovascular studies, position BGP-15 as a strong candidate for further preclinical evaluation in ocular models. However, the transition from robust in vitro data to successful clinical outcomes in an ocular setting requires additional comprehensive in vivo studies to evaluate efficacy, optimal dosing, and delivery methods. Addressing these gaps through well-designed animal studies and eventually early-phase clinical trials will be critical in determining whether BGP-15 can fulfill its promise as a novel therapeutic for enhancing RPE function and slowing the progression of dry age-related macular degeneration (Campelj et al., 2020; Takács et al., 2024; Wachal, 2023).

In conclusion, BGP-15 offers significant potential as a multifunctional therapeutic agent for dry AMD by targeting crucial pathways involved in proteostasis, autophagy, and mitochondrial function. Its ability to modulate HSP70 expression stands out as a particularly valuable mechanism given the central role of heat shock proteins in RPE cell homeostasis and survival under chronic oxidative and proteotoxic stress. Despite the challenges and uncertainties inherent in repurposing a drug from metabolic and cardioprotective contexts to an ocular application, the promising early data support continued investigation. Further studies focusing on detailed pharmacodynamics in RPE cells, collateral effects on immune and inflammatory responses, and rigorous in vivo efficacy evaluations are warranted before BGP-15 can be advanced into clinical trials for dry AMD. The overall evaluation is favorable, with strengths in its multi-targeted approach, established safety in non-ocular models, and strong mechanistic rationale, balanced by the need for further research specifically addressing its ocular pharmacokinetics and long-term efficacy in mitigating the complex pathophysiology of dry AMD (Berkovich et al., 2010; Budzyński et al., 2017; Pető et al., 2020; Takács et al., 2024).
