Proposal for Trehalose

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Trehalose is a natural non‐reducing disaccharide found in diverse organisms including bacteria, fungi, plants, and invertebrates. It is synthesized via enzymes such as trehalose-6-phosphate synthase and trehalose phosphorylase in organisms that accumulate it as a stress protectant, although in humans trehalose is taken from the diet or administered exogenically as a therapeutic agent (Maiuolo et al., 2022). This compound belongs to the class of naturally occurring sugars with well‐recognized protein‐ and membrane‐stabilizing properties. In addition to its nutritional use as a safe food ingredient approved by regulatory agencies such as the U.S. FDA and European systems since 2000, trehalose has garnered considerable interest as an autophagy enhancer that activates cytoprotective pathways (Abokyi et al., 2020). In recent years, trehalose has emerged as a repurposed therapeutic candidate in neurodegenerative diseases due to its properties to mitigate oxidative stress and protein aggregation; this same rationale has now been extended to age‐related macular degeneration (AMD), given the shared aspects of cellular stress and autophagy dysregulation between neurodegenerative disorders and retinal diseases (Abokyi, 2021).

Therapeutic History:
Trehalose’s therapeutic history is extensive and spans preclinical studies as well as exploratory clinical investigations. It has been used clinically in ocular formulations for dry eye disease and postsurgical management after laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), and it has been explored in models of neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington’s and Parkinson’s diseases (Maiuolo et al., 2022). Multiple studies have shown that trehalose can induce autophagy and upregulate lysosomal biogenesis in various cell types, including neuronal and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells (Abokyi et al., 2020). Preclinical in vitro studies using human RPE cells, such as ARPE-19 cells, have demonstrated that trehalose can reduce accumulation of lipofuscin and autofluorescent granules by enhancing the clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (POS), which are pivotal in dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) pathogenesis (Abokyi et al., 2020). While trehalose itself has not yet been approved for the treatment of dry AMD in humans, its usage in related ocular conditions and positive outcomes in animal models of retinal degeneration provide a strong preliminary foundation for its repurposing (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Furthermore, rodent pharmacokinetic studies have confirmed retinal delivery after oral administration, supporting its feasibility for ocular therapeutic strategies (carrying forward observations from relevant pharmacokinetic investigations reported in the literature, as indicated by various preclinical studies summarized in the context).

Mechanism of Action:
The molecular mechanism of trehalose in promoting cytoprotection is multifaceted and distinct from classical mTOR inhibitors. Trehalose has been shown to induce autophagy by facilitating the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor EB (TFEB), which is a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy (Abokyi et al., 2020). Under normal conditions, TFEB is retained in the cytoplasm in an inactive, phosphorylated state largely via mTORC1 activity; however, trehalose acts independently of mTOR by causing a slight disturbance in lysosomal homeostasis—likely through a mild increase in lysosomal pH or via endocytic uptake that leads to modest lysosomal stress—and this triggers the dephosphorylation and subsequent nuclear import of TFEB (Jeong et al., 2021). Once in the nucleus, TFEB binds to the coordinated lysosomal expression and regulation (CLEAR) network of genes and upregulates key lysosomal proteins such as LAMP1 and cathepsins (e.g., CTSB), as well as autophagy markers like LC3-II and p62, thereby enhancing autophagic flux and lysosomal degradation processes (Abokyi et al., 2020; Abokyi, 2021). In RPE cells, this mechanism is particularly relevant because these cells continuously phagocytose the shed POS from photoreceptors; therefore, enriching their lysosomal capacity via TFEB activation can improve the clearance of accumulated debris, which if left unchecked, contributes to retinal degeneration in dry AMD (Abokyi, 2021). Biochemical studies in ARPE-19 cells have confirmed that trehalose treatment markedly increases autophagosome formation (as shown by increased LC3-II levels) and facilitates proteolytic degradation via the lysosomal pathway (Abokyi et al., 2020). Moreover, trehalose appears to enhance both macroautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) pathways, as suggested by upregulation of LAMP2 and cathepsin D, further solidifying its role as a robust autophagy enhancer that might directly benefit photoreceptor outer segment degradation in RPE cells (Abokyi, 2021).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis is that trehalose will induce TFEB nuclear translocation in RPE cells, thereby upregulating a program of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagic degradation that ultimately enhances the clearance of photoreceptor outer segments. In the proposed assay, primary human RPE cultures treated with an accumulation-inducing agent such as A2E will mimic the lipofuscin buildup characteristic of dry AMD. When treated with trehalose, a reported concentration of 100 mM in these in vitro models has demonstrated a reduction in autofluorescent granules by approximately 50% and an increase in POS degradation by around 30% (Abokyi et al., 2020). This is presumably due to the upregulated lysosomal and autophagic activity mediated by TFEB nuclear translocation. Additionally, trehalose’s engagement with the proteasomal degradation system has been shown to enhance proteasomal activity, thereby contributing to the degradation of misfolded proteins without causing cytotoxicity (Abokyi, 2021). The expected effect of trehalose in the RPE assay is to restore cellular homeostasis by clearing accumulated POS and damaged proteins, thereby improving RPE cell functionality. Given that photoreceptor outer segment clearance is a critical function of RPE cells and is compromised in dry AMD, restoration of this process via trehalose-induced autophagic flux should mitigate the underlying pathogenesis of dry AMD (Abokyi et al., 2020). Furthermore, controlled dosing is essential, as studies have indicated that high doses (e.g., above 100 mM) might lead to excessive autophagy activation and even apoptotic cell death, while moderate doses (around 50 mM) are effective yet safe, providing a clear therapeutic window (Abokyi et al., 2020; Abokyi, 2021).

Overall Evaluation:
In evaluating trehalose as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry AMD, several strengths and weaknesses become apparent. One of the chief strengths of trehalose lies in its well-characterized safety profile, having been used as a food additive and in clinical formulations for ocular conditions such as dry eye disease with minimal cytotoxicity at therapeutically relevant doses (Maiuolo et al., 2022). Its natural origin and ease of formulation provide additional advantages in terms of regulatory approval and patient tolerability. Mechanistically, trehalose directly addresses key cellular dysfunctions noted in dry AMD by enhancing autophagic flux and lysosomal biogenesis through TFEB nuclear translocation, a pathway that is compromised in aging RPE cells (Abokyi et al., 2020; Abokyi, 2021). The ability to upregulate autophagy markers such as LC3-II, p62, LAMP2, and cathepsin D, alongside improved clearance of photoreceptor outer segment debris, positions trehalose as a promising candidate to restore RPE phagocytic function and mitigate oxidative stress-induced retinal degeneration (Abokyi et al., 2020; Abokyi, 2021).

However, there are weaknesses to consider. Some studies have noted that prolonged exposure to high concentrations of trehalose can induce excessive ER stress or autophagy overactivation, potentially leading to apoptotic cell death if the dosing is not carefully controlled (Abokyi, 2021). This underscores the importance of rigorous dose-ranging studies to identify the optimal concentration that enhances lysosomal flux without triggering detrimental stress responses (Abokyi et al., 2020). Additionally, while in vitro studies and rodent models have provided supportive pharmacokinetic and mechanistic evidence, the translational relevance to human dry AMD requires further validation in clinical trials, particularly given the complexity of AMD pathogenesis which involves multi-factorial components including inflammation, lipid dysregulation, and genetic susceptibility (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Vessey et al., 2022). The preclinical data also come, in part, from studies published in sources that have raised concerns regarding journal quality, necessitating independent replication in high-impact, peer-reviewed settings (Abokyi et al., 2020; Abokyi, 2021). Although preliminary studies indicate retinal delivery after oral administration, the pharmacokinetic profile in humans, including absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME), must be clearly elucidated to guarantee adequate bioavailability in the retina (Karim et al., 2020).

Overall, trehalose presents as a plausible and mechanism-specific candidate for dry AMD therapy with several attractive attributes: it is a natural compound with an established safety record, it directly targets the dysregulated autophagy-lysosomal pathway implicated in AMD, and it has demonstrated efficacy in reducing pathological accumulations in RPE cells under oxidative stress conditions. The strategy of enhancing TFEB nuclear translocation to boost lysosomal biogenesis not only addresses the hallmark features of dry AMD—such as impaired clearance of photoreceptor outer segments—but also potentially ameliorates other aspects of cellular stress and protein aggregation that contribute to retinal degeneration (Abokyi, 2021; Bejarano et al., 2024). Nonetheless, the therapeutic window must be firmly established to avoid the pitfalls of excessive autophagy activation, and further validation in clinically relevant models is required to bridge the gap between preclinical promise and human efficacy. In conclusion, while there are challenges to overcome, trehalose remains a highly promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for restoring RPE function in dry AMD, meriting further investigation through well-designed preclinical studies and ultimately clinical trials to fully ascertain its efficacy and safety profile in this patient population (Vessey et al., 2022; Abokyi, 2021).
