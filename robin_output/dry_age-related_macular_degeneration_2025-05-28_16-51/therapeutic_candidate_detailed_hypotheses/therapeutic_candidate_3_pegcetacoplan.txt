Proposal for Pegcetacoplan (APL-2; Apellis Pharmaceuticals)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Pegcetacoplan (APL-2) is a synthetic, PEGylated cyclic peptide that belongs to the compstatin class of complement inhibitors. The origin of pegcetacoplan can be traced back to the discovery of compstatin, a 13–14‐amino acid cyclic peptide identified via phage display screening using complement component C3b as bait; this natural peptide scaffold was subsequently optimized through structure‐guided modifications, including backbone N-methylation and conjugation to polyethylene glycol (PEG) to enhance its pharmacokinetic properties and solubility (Mastellos et al., 2022, pp. 2–3). Pegcetacoplan itself is derived by linking two copies of a second-generation compstatin analog using a 40-kDa PEG moiety, a modification that not only increases its plasma half-life but also ensures appropriate ocular bioavailability when delivered via intravitreal injection (Kim et al., 2022, pp. 4–5; Mastellos et al., 2022, pp. 2–3). As a representative of a new class of complement C3 inhibitors, pegcetacoplan has been designed to modulate complement activation at an early, nodal point in the cascade. Historically, compounds from the compstatin family have been investigated for their potential in various complement-mediated diseases, with earlier versions undergoing evaluation in conditions such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD), thereby providing a robust platform for repurposing in ocular diseases (Mastellos et al., 2019, pp. 12–13; Liao et al., 2020, pp. 1–2).

Therapeutic History:
Pegcetacoplan is not a novel concept in terms of complement inhibition; rather, it represents the culmination of years of research into the compstatin family. Preclinical studies demonstrated that inhibiting complement C3 can ameliorate complement-driven inflammation and decrease deposition of activation fragments in tissues—findings initially applied to PNH and later extended to ocular diseases (Mastellos et al., 2022, pp. 1–2). Clinical studies of pegcetacoplan have steadily progressed from early-phase trials in wet AMD patients (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2015) to more advanced trials specifically targeted to geographic atrophy (GA)—a late form of dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021). In particular, the Phase II trial in GA showed that monthly intravitreal injections of pegcetacoplan significantly reduced the growth rate of atrophic lesions by up to 29%, with enhanced effects observed in the latter half of the treatment period (Liao et al., 2020, pp. 1–2, 7–8). Additionally, phase III studies (OAKS and DERBY) have confirmed these findings in larger patient populations, demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in GA lesion enlargement compared to sham injections (Unknown Reference). Therefore, the drug class not only has a history of use in complement-mediated hematological disorders but also has shown promising efficacy signals in dry AMD, where no approved therapy previously existed (Nadeem et al., 2023, pp. 1–2, 10–11).

Mechanism of Action:
Pegcetacoplan exerts its therapeutic action by binding to complement component C3 and its activated fragment C3b, thereby preventing the enzymatic cleavage of C3 into its active fragments (C3a and C3b) by the C3 convertases (Desai & Dugel, 2022, pp. 4–6; Liao et al., 2020, pp. 7–8). This binding interferes with all three complement activation pathways (classical, lectin, and alternative), effectively blunting the entire downstream cascade that leads to the formation of potent inflammatory mediators such as C5a and the membrane attack complex (MAC) (Kim et al., 2022, pp. 12–13; Desai & Dugel, 2022, p. 6). On a molecular level, by blocking C3 activation, pegcetacoplan reduces the deposition of complement activation products (such as C3b, iC3b) on the surfaces of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells and within the sub-RPE space, where accumulation in drusen is associated with disease progression (Bakri et al., 2023, pp. 4–6; Liao et al., 2020, pp. 7–8). Moreover, the drug attenuates C3a-mediated inflammasome priming—a process by which low-level chronic complement activation leads to the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in RPE cells, resulting in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and subsequent cellular damage (Cruz-Pimentel & Wu, 2023, pp. 7–8; Desai & Dugel, 2022, pp. 6–8). By mitigating these complement-driven inflammatory processes, pegcetacoplan is hypothesized to preserve both the phagocytic and autophagic functions of the RPE, thereby protecting these vital cells from degeneration and slowing the progression of GA (Nadeem et al., 2023, pp. 2–4; Kim et al., 2022, p. 13).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis underlying the use of pegcetacoplan for dry AMD is that its local delivery via intravitreal injection will result in high ocular drug levels while minimizing systemic exposure (Liao et al., 2020, pp. 1–2). In the sub-RPE space, pegcetacoplan is expected to prevent excessive C3 cleavage, which, in turn, will reduce the deposition of C3b and its inactivated breakdown products such as iC3b. This reduction is crucial because accumulated complement fragments can trigger and propagate local inflammation by priming the NLRP3 inflammasome and recruiting inflammatory cells (Cruz-Pimentel & Wu, 2023, pp. 3–4; Desai & Dugel, 2022, pp. 4–6). As a result, the inflammatory milieu typically associated with drusen and GA formation will be attenuated, which is anticipated to preserve the normal phagocytic and autophagic functions of RPE cells (Bakri et al., 2023, pp. 4–6; Nadeem et al., 2023, pp. 2–4). Clinically, this molecular modulation translates into a deceleration of geographic atrophy lesion expansion, as corroborated by the Phase II trial results where treated eyes demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in GA progression compared to sham-treated eyes (Liao et al., 2020, pp. 1–2; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018). Additionally, because RPE cell dysfunction is a critical driver of subsequent photoreceptor degeneration, maintaining RPE health through the control of complement overactivation may contribute to preserving visual function—even if improvements in visual acuity are secondary to stabilization of the anatomic defect (Nadeem et al., 2023, pp. 10–11).

Overall Evaluation:
Pegcetacoplan represents a promising therapeutic candidate for dry AMD, particularly in the context of geographic atrophy, where there are no currently approved treatments. One of its significant strengths is the robust genetic and molecular validation of complement C3 involvement in AMD pathogenesis—a fact supported by GWAS and genotype–phenotype correlations that have repeatedly identified C3 variants as key risk factors in the disease (Nadeem et al., 2023, pp. 2–4; Liao et al., 2020, pp. 1–2). The compound’s mechanism of action, which involves the direct binding to and inhibition of C3 and C3b, allows for a comprehensive blockade of all complement activation pathways, thereby mitigating several downstream pathogenic processes such as inflammasome priming, phagocytic dysregulation, and drusen accumulation (Desai & Dugel, 2022, pp. 4–6; Kim et al., 2022, pp. 12–13).

Moreover, the clinical proof-of-concept is compelling. Early-phase clinical trials have shown that pegcetacoplan can significantly slow the progression of GA in patients with dry AMD, and its intravitreal administration ensures that high local drug concentrations are achieved with minimal systemic exposure—a critical consideration given potential systemic immunosuppressive risks (Liao et al., 2020, pp. 1–2; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021). The reduction in GA lesion growth not only provides a promising surrogate endpoint but also hints at the downstream benefits of preserving RPE and, eventually, photoreceptor function (Bakri et al., 2023, pp. 4–6; Nadeem et al., 2023, pp. 10–11).

However, there are also some challenges and potential weaknesses to consider. One concern involves the safety profile, particularly the observation of increased rates of exudative AMD in some clinical studies. Although these events appear to be manageable with anti-VEGF treatments and may be partly attributable to baseline risk factors in treated populations, they nonetheless underscore the need for continued long-term safety monitoring (Liao et al., 2020, pp. 7–8; Cruz-Pimentel & Wu, 2023, pp. 7–8). Additionally, while the biochemical rationale for complement inhibition is robust, translating this effect into meaningful clinical benefits—especially improvements in visual function rather than mere anatomic stabilization—remains a critical challenge (Desai & Dugel, 2022, pp. 6–8; Nadeem et al., 2023, pp. 10–11). There is also the practical consideration of chronic intravitreal injections in a predominantly elderly patient population, which could have implications for treatment adherence and overall quality of life (Kim et al., 2022, p. 13).

In summary, pegcetacoplan exhibits significant potential as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry AMD based on its well-defined mechanism of action targeting complement C3, strong genetic validation from multiple independent studies, and encouraging clinical trial outcomes in reducing GA lesion growth. Its design as a PEGylated compstatin-based inhibitor leverages both natural peptide scaffolding and advanced medicinal chemistry to achieve high ocular bioavailability with minimal systemic exposure. While outstanding questions—particularly concerning long-term safety, the risk of exudative conversion, and functional vision outcomes—remain to be fully addressed, the overall scientific rationale and clinical data strongly support further development and investment in this therapeutic candidate as a means to address the significant unmet need in dry AMD (Mastellos et al., 2019, pp. 12–13; Liao et al., 2020, pp. 1–2; Nadeem et al., 2023, pp. 1–2).
