Proposal for Canakinumab (Ilaris)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Canakinumab, marketed under the trade name Ilaris®, is a fully human monoclonal antibody engineered to target and neutralize interleukin‐1 beta (IL-1β), a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine. Its discovery and synthesis took advantage of advanced recombinant DNA and transgenic mouse (HuMab-Mouse™) technologies, whereby the endogenous immunoglobulin genes of mice were inactivated and replaced with human immunoglobulin sequences to produce fully human antibodies (Dhimolea, 2010; Gram, 2016). The antibody is expressed in mammalian cell lines, such as NS0 or Sp2/0, generating clinical-grade material that meets stringent regulatory requirements, and it belongs to the immunomodulatory biologic class—a group of therapeutics designed to inhibit specific cytokine signaling pathways. Monoclonal antibodies of this class have a rich history in clinical medicine; they have been used to neutralize cytokines in diseases ranging from rheumatoid arthritis and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis to autoinflammatory syndromes like cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS). Their targeted approach spares large parts of the immune system, limiting side effects compared to broad spectrum immunosuppressants (Dhimolea, 2010; Dübel & Reichert, 2014).

Therapeutic History:
Canakinumab has undergone an extensive clinical development program across several inflammatory and autoinflammatory diseases that have an underlying IL-1β pathology. It initially demonstrated remarkable efficacy and safety in clinical studies targeting CAPS, including Muckle-Wells syndrome and familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2007). In subsequent clinical studies, canakinumab was evaluated for conditions ranging from rheumatoid arthritis to cardiovascular inflammation in patients with a high inflammatory burden (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2005; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2010). These trials established not only the biochemical mechanism of IL-1β neutralization but also the favorable pharmacokinetic properties—namely its long elimination half-life (approximately 26 days) allowing infrequent dosing and robust systemic anti-inflammatory activity (Chakraborty et al., 2012; Dhimolea, 2010). Although its approved indications do not include age-related macular degeneration (AMD) directly, its mechanism has been explored in diseases that share common inflammatory pathways with dry AMD. Several preclinical studies and translational research efforts have underscored the role of IL-1β in ocular inflammation and retinal degeneration, thereby rationalizing the repurposing of canakinumab for dry AMD. Notably, while clinical trials specific to dry AMD are limited at present, the widespread use of canakinumab in systemic inflammatory diseases strongly supports its potential cross-application in ocular conditions (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2010; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2011; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2011).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, canakinumab exerts its therapeutic effects by binding IL-1β with exceptionally high affinity—in the sub-nanomolar range (approximately 40 pM)—thereby neutralizing its ability to interact with the IL-1 receptor (IL-1R). The crystal structure of the canakinumab/IL-1β complex, as elucidated in several studies, demonstrates that the antibody binds to a discontinuous epitope that is crucial for IL-1β’s biological activity; key residues such as Glu64 form part of this epitope, and binding of canakinumab sterically hinders IL-1β from engaging its receptor (Dhimolea, 2010; Gram, 2016). In doing so, the monoclonal antibody prevents the recruitment of the IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP) and subsequent activation of downstream signaling cascades, such as NF-κB and MAPK pathways, which are responsible for inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-6 and TNF-α. This targeted blockade of IL-1β interrupts the autocrine and paracrine cycles of inflammation that are driven by inflammasome activation. In many inflammatory diseases, chronic deregulation of IL-1β production leads to tissue damage; therefore, by blocking this central pro-inflammatory mediator, canakinumab modulates the immune response and attenuates inflammation. In the context of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, such neutralization is critically important, as IL-1β overactivity has been associated with decreased expression of phagocytic receptors like MerTK and integrins, thereby impeding the clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) and contributing to the progression of dry AMD (Brandstetter, 2016; Fabiani et al., 2017).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis in our proposal is that by neutralizing IL-1β in the subretinal microenvironment, canakinumab will reduce both local and systemic inflammation that contributes to the pathogenesis of dry AMD. Elevated IL-1β levels in the vitreous fluid of AMD patients and in RPE cell cultures have been correlated with downregulated expression of key phagocytic receptors such as MerTK. With IL-1β being a central mediator of this chronic inflammatory state, canakinumab’s potent neutralization is expected to lead to the following in vitro and, eventually, in vivo effects: (1) a significant reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, exemplified by reported reductions in IL-6 and TNF-α levels that approach 75% at a concentration of 100 ng/mL in RPE assays, (2) preservation and possibly restoration of MerTK expression on RPE cells, and (3) an increased uptake of FITC-labeled photoreceptor outer segments (an observed increase of 33%)—all of which contribute to the restoration of effective phagocytosis of shed POS (Fabiani et al., 2017; Campbell & Doyle, 2013). In addition to these cellular effects, neutralization of IL-1β also interrupts the pro-inflammatory signaling cascade that is known to amplify retinal degeneration through chronic inflammasome activation (Campbell & Doyle, 2013; Brandstetter, 2016). Because RPE cells rely on MerTK-mediated phagocytosis for their normal turnover of POS—a function that is imperative for retinal homeostasis—the preservation of receptor expression and function under inflammatory stress is a key therapeutic target. In RPE assays, by preventing IL-1β from binding its receptor, canakinumab is expected not only to reduce the secretion of harmful cytokines but also to allow cellular repair mechanisms to re‐establish proper phagocytic function. This effect is particularly pertinent given evidence that IL-1β inhibition positively modulates integrin signaling and MerTK-associated pathways, ultimately leading to improved clearance of debris that accumulates in the subretinal space—a critical therapeutic goal in dry AMD (Dhimolea, 2010; Fabiani et al., 2017; Campbell & Doyle, 2013).

Overall Evaluation:
The use of canakinumab as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is supported by a robust biochemical rationale, a well-defined mechanism of action, and extensive clinical experience in other IL-1β-mediated inflammatory diseases. One of the major strengths of canakinumab is its high specificity and sub-nanomolar affinity for IL-1β, which ensures that even low levels of the cytokine are effectively neutralized. This precision, derived from its thoroughly characterized binding epitope and validated through ligand–receptor interaction studies (Dhimolea, 2010; Chakraborty et al., 2012), allows canakinumab to mitigate chronic inflammatory signaling without broadly suppressing the immune system. Moreover, the favorable systemic safety profile observed in large-scale clinical trials for conditions such as CAPS, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and cardiovascular inflammation lends considerable support to its translational feasibility for ocular applications. Importantly, studies have shown that canakinumab administration is associated with reduced levels of IL-6 and TNF-α and preserves critical phagocytic receptors in RPE cell assays, translating into a measurable improvement in the uptake of photoreceptor outer segments—a key functional marker in dry AMD (Fabiani et al., 2017; Campbell & Doyle, 2013).

Nevertheless, several challenges and weaknesses must be acknowledged. First, while the preclinical and biochemical data strongly support an IL-1β-driven mechanism in AMD, there is currently a scarcity of clinical trial data directly related to dry AMD. Most of the existing trials of canakinumab (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov, 2007; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2011) have focused on systemic inflammatory and autoinflammatory conditions rather than ocular diseases. Thus, extrapolating the systemic safety and efficacy profile to the retinal context, although promising, remains speculative until direct ophthalmologic studies are conducted (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2007; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2011). Second, effective drug delivery remains a significant concern. The subretinal microenvironment has barriers that may limit the penetration and local concentration of systemically administered monoclonal antibodies. Although systemic dosing has a proven safety record, achieving therapeutic levels in the eye may require alternative administration strategies—such as intravitreal injection—which present their own set of challenges in terms of dosing frequency, potential local side effects, and patient acceptance (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Third, while in vitro assays confirm that canakinumab at 100 ng/mL significantly reduces inflammatory cytokine secretion and improves phagocytosis in RPE cells, the in vivo translation of these effects remains to be carefully validated in animal models of dry AMD before clinical application in humans can be confidently recommended (Fabiani et al., 2017; Campbell & Doyle, 2013). Finally, since the underlying pathogenic mechanisms in dry AMD are multifactorial, incorporating oxidative stress, complement dysregulation, and chronic low-grade inflammation, targeting IL-1β alone may not be sufficient to fully restore RPE function or halt disease progression. Combination therapy approaches, potentially integrating IL-1β inhibition with antioxidants or agents targeting the complement pathway, may be required to achieve optimal therapeutic outcomes (Brandstetter, 2016; Campbell & Doyle, 2013).

In conclusion, canakinumab emerges as a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry AMD based on its established role in neutralizing IL-1β, its documented efficacy in reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine production and preserving phagocytic receptor expression in preclinical RPE cell assays, and its overall favorable safety profile in systemic inflammatory diseases. However, further studies are essential to determine the appropriate delivery methods to achieve effective retinal concentrations and to validate its therapeutic benefits in relevant animal models before proceeding to targeted clinical trials in dry AMD patients. The mechanistic and biochemical rationale is strong, yet clinical proof-of-concept in the ocular setting remains an unmet need. Therefore, the next steps should include rigorous preclinical evaluation in AMD models, coupled with pharmacokinetic assessments aimed at optimizing ocular bioavailability, followed by carefully designed early-phase clinical trials to evaluate efficacy, safety, and appropriate dosing in the context of dry AMD. With these considerations in mind, canakinumab represents a rational and innovative approach to modulating the chronic inflammatory barrier in dry AMD by restoring MerTK- and integrin-mediated phagocytosis through selective IL-1β blockade (Dhimolea, 2010; Fabiani et al., 2017; Campbell & Doyle, 2013).
