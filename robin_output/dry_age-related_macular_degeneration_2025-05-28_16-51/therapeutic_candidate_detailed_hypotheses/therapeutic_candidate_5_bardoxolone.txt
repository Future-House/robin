Proposal for Bardoxolone methyl (CDDO-Me)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Bardoxolone methyl (also known as CDDO-Me) is a synthetic triterpenoid derivative originally developed via chemical modification of oleanolic acid to enhance its cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory properties (Handa, 2012). It belongs to the class of synthetic triterpenoids, a group that has been widely investigated for their ability to modulate redox-sensitive signaling pathways, particularly by activating the NRF2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2) transcription factor (Morilla, Ghosal, & Romero, 2023). This compound is recognizable by its electrophilic centers, which enable covalent modification of specific cysteine residues on target proteins such as KEAP1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1), ultimately leading to the activation of NRF2 (Handa, 2012). In general, this class of compounds has been used in various systemic indications including chronic kidney disease and certain cancers, leveraging their potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
Bardoxolone methyl has an extensive preclinical and clinical record in diseases characterized by heightened oxidative stress and inflammation, as evidenced by its evaluation in phase II and phase III trials for conditions such as type 2 diabetic kidney disease (Handa, 2012). Although its primary use has been focused on systemic disorders, there is currently no registered clinical trial in major registries such as ClinicalTrials.gov evaluating bardoxolone methyl specifically for dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) or related retinal conditions (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). However, there exists emerging preclinical evidence that supports its potential utility in ocular contexts; for instance, studies in rodent models have demonstrated that NRF2 activation can lead to reduced Bruch’s membrane thickening, a hallmark of early AMD pathology, as well as preservation of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) morphology under oxidative stress conditions (Handa, 2012). Additionally, the robust safety and pharmacokinetic profile established for bardoxolone methyl in non-ocular indications offers a significant advantage when considering drug repurposing for dry AMD (Basyal, Lee, & Kim, 2024).

Mechanism of Action:
Bardoxolone methyl functions primarily by covalently modifying critical cysteine residues on the KEAP1 protein via Michael addition reactions, thereby disrupting the KEAP1-NRF2 complex and preventing the proteasomal degradation of NRF2 (Handa, 2012). This disruption allows NRF2 to accumulate and translocate into the nucleus, where it binds to antioxidant response elements (ARE) in the promoter regions of genes encoding several phase II detoxification enzymes and antioxidant proteins such as superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and glutamate–cysteine ligase modifier subunit (GCLM) (Handa, 2012). These enzymes are fundamental for maintaining redox homeostasis, as they catalyze the detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and support glutathione synthesis, which is essential for cellular antioxidant capacity (Basyal, Lee, & Kim, 2024). In the context of the retinal pigment epithelium, where oxidative stress can disrupt lysosomal pH and inhibit phagocytosis, the upregulation of these antioxidant enzymes is hypothesized to restore lysosomal integrity and improve the clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) (Handa, 2012). The mechanistic rationale is that by reducing oxidative damage through enhanced antioxidant defense, bardoxolone methyl may counteract the cascade of events leading to lysosomal impairment and RPE dysfunction observed in dry AMD (Abokyi, 2021).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis posits that bardoxolone methyl will induce the expression of ARE–driven phase II detoxification enzymes in RPE cells, thereby mitigating oxidative stress that impairs lysosomal function and phagocytosis, a critical process for maintaining retinal homeostasis (Basyal, Lee, & Kim, 2024). In vitro studies have shown that treatment of primary human RPE monolayers subjected to photo-oxidative stress results in a restoration of lysosomal pH and an approximately 40% increase in the degradation of photoreceptor outer segments, indicative of improved phagocytic function (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). The expected molecular effect is mediated by bardoxolone methyl’s activation of NRF2, which elevates mRNA and protein levels of antioxidant enzymes, protecting the RPE from oxidative insults and facilitating the clearance of accumulated metabolic debris (Handa, 2012). Such responses are particularly relevant given that RPE cells express high levels of NRF2-regulated genes under oxidative challenge, and their proper functioning is crucial for preventing the progression of dry AMD (Abokyi, 2021).

Overall Evaluation:
Bardoxolone methyl presents itself as a therapeutically promising candidate for dry AMD based on a well-validated molecular target and a compelling pharmacologic rationale; its potent activation of the NRF2 pathway offers a direct means to counteract the oxidative stress that underpins much of AMD pathology (Handa, 2012). One of the main strengths of this therapeutic candidate lies in its extensive clinical history in systemic diseases, where favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profiles have been extensively characterized, suggesting a strong translational potential (Basyal, Lee, & Kim, 2024). Moreover, the mechanistic specificity – namely the covalent modification of KEAP1 leading to upregulation of key cytoprotective enzymes (SOD2, HO-1, GCLM) – directly addresses the biochemical deficits observed in the RPE during dry AMD, particularly the impaired lysosomal function and defective clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (Handa, 2012). However, the major weakness is the absence of direct clinical evidence or extensive preclinical data specifically in ocular models or dry AMD contexts, as current clinical trial registries do not yet document studies exploring its use in retinal degenerative conditions (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additionally, while systemic administration has been well tolerated in other indications, the translation of systemic dosing to achieve efficacious concentrations in the retina may present challenges, including issues related to retinal penetration, potential off-target effects, and the differential physiology of ocular tissues compared to systemic targets (Morilla, Ghosal, & Romero, 2023). In summary, while bardoxolone methyl shows significant mechanistic promise for treating dry AMD by restoring antioxidant capacity and improving the phagocytic function of RPE cells, further focused preclinical ophthalmic studies are warranted to validate its efficacy in retinal models and to optimize dosing strategies that ensure adequate ocular bioavailability (Abokyi, 2021). The overall evaluation supports continued investigation into bardoxolone methyl as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry AMD, with the potential to address an unmet medical need if subsequent in vivo studies and eventual clinical trials confirm its beneficial effects in the retina (Basyal, Lee, & Kim, 2024).
