Proposal for Eculizumab (Soliris; Alexion Pharmaceuticals)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate
Eculizumab (Soliris), developed by Alexion Pharmaceuticals, is a recombinant, humanized immunoglobulin G monoclonal antibody originally derived from a murine anti‐C5 antibody that was subsequently engineered for optimal human compatibility (Bandello et al., 2017; Mata & Vogel, 2010). Synthesized using recombinant DNA technology in mammalian cell cultures, eculizumab is characterized by its high specificity for complement component C5 and its capacity to inhibit its cleavage into C5a and C5b. It belongs to the class of complement inhibitors—a group of targeted biologics designed to modulate the complement cascade by specifically binding and neutralizing key mediators that propagate inflammation and cellular damage (Bandello et al., 2017). Over the past decade, complement inhibitors have been successfully employed to treat systemic disorders in which complement overactivation plays a central pathogenic role, with eculizumab itself being approved for specific complement‐mediated diseases such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) (Mata & Vogel, 2010). In these conditions, its mechanism of action—blocking the terminal step of the complement cascade—has proven to be both effective and life‐saving. This established broad clinical profile and manufacturing feasibility position eculizumab as a promising candidate for repurposing in dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD), a disease in which chronic complement dysregulation drives retinal degeneration (Armento et al., 2021).

Therapeutic History
Eculizumab’s clinical journey began with its evaluation in systemic disorders where uncontrolled complement activation is a central element of pathology. In the hematologic disorder paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), for instance, eculizumab’s ability to inhibit the formation of C5a and the membrane attack complex (MAC) has led to marked reductions in intravascular hemolysis and improved patient outcomes (Mata & Vogel, 2010). Its subsequent approval for atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) further emphasized its efficacy in halting complement-mediated tissue injury (Bandello et al., 2017). Given these successes, it was hypothesized that complement-mediated processes might also underlie the pathogenesis of dry AMD, particularly the geographic atrophy (GA) form. Histopathologic and genetic studies have consistently pointed to the role of complement dysregulation in dry AMD, with evidence of elevated C5a in retinal lesions and associations between genomic variants in complement genes and increased disease risk (Armento et al., 2021; Gemenetzi & Lotery, 2016). In dry AMD, the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) undergoes chronic inflammatory insult that is partly driven by complement activation leading to inflammasome priming and subsequent pyroptosis (Brandstetter, 2016). Based on this rationale, clinical investigations were undertaken to evaluate the repurposing of eculizumab for dry AMD. The COMPLETE Phase II trial, which investigated systemic administration of eculizumab in patients with GA, demonstrated that while the drug was well tolerated, it did not yield a statistically significant reduction in GA lesion progression (Halawa et al., 2021). Other complementary studies have explored alternative routes of administration, with intravitreal delivery being favored in preclinical studies to overcome the blood-retina barrier (BRB) and achieve therapeutic retinal levels (Hammadi et al., 2023). This therapeutic history underscores both the potential of repurposing eculizumab for conditions beyond its original indications and the challenges of translating systemic complement inhibition to the retinal environment (Bandello et al., 2017; Halawa et al., 2021).

Mechanism of Action
At the molecular level, eculizumab exerts its pharmacologic effect by binding with high affinity to complement component C5, a central protein in the terminal cascade of the complement system (Armento et al., 2021). Under physiologic conditions, the complement system can be activated through three distinct pathways—the classical, lectin, and alternative pathways—all culminating in the activation of complement component C3 and the subsequent generation of C3a and C3b. C3b participates in the formation of the C5 convertase, an enzymatic complex that cleaves C5 into its active fragments, C5a and C5b (Holz et al., 2014). C5a is a potent anaphylatoxin that contributes to inflammation by recruiting immune cells and promoting the release of cytokines, whereas C5b initiates the assembly of the membrane attack complex (MAC, C5b-9), leading to cell lysis or sublytic injury (Armento et al., 2021).
In the context of dry AMD, elevated levels of C5a in the retina have been implicated in the priming of the NLRP3 inflammasome in RPE cells, which results in caspase-1 activation and the execution of pyroptosis—a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death (Brandstetter, 2016). Pyroptosis in the RPE is thought to contribute to the degeneration of supporting retinal structures and the eventual loss of photoreceptors responsible for vision. Concomitantly, the formation of MAC may contribute to subtle cytolytic effects on RPE cells, compromising their viability and disrupting essential functions such as the clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) via autophagy and MerTK-mediated phagocytosis (Armento et al., 2021; Holz et al., 2014).
Eculizumab’s mode of action hinges on its binding to a critical epitope on the C5 molecule that is necessary for the action of C5 convertase. By locking C5 in an uncleaved state, eculizumab prevents the formation of both C5a and C5b, thereby abrogating the terminal events of the complement cascade (Armento et al., 2021; Brandstetter, 2016). This molecular blockade reduces downstream complement-mediated inflammation and cell lysis, a process that is particularly deleterious in the delicate environment of the retina. Additionally, the prevention of MAC assembly contributes to the preservation of RPE cell membrane integrity and function, which is critical for maintaining retinal homeostasis (Holz et al., 2014).
Furthermore, by impeding complement-driven inflammatory pathways, eculizumab may indirectly facilitate the stabilization of autophagic–lysosomal functioning in RPE cells. This is of paramount importance because the RPE is responsible for the continual phagocytosis and clearance of shed POS—a process that is intricately linked to cellular health and overall retinal function. Disruption of this clearance mechanism has been implicated in the accumulation of toxic debris and the formation of drusen, hallmark features of dry AMD (Armento et al., 2021). In summary, eculizumab’s molecular action of blocking C5 cleavage represents a targeted intervention aimed at neutralizing key pro-inflammatory and cytolytic mediators in the complement cascade, with anticipated downstream benefits in preserving RPE viability and function (Brandstetter, 2016).

Expected Effect
In dry AMD, particularly in the form of geographic atrophy, the progressive degeneration of the RPE layer leads to subsequent photoreceptor loss and eventual irreversible visual impairment. The working hypothesis for repurposing eculizumab in this context is based on its ability to mitigate several complement-mediated pathological processes that drive RPE degeneration (Armento et al., 2021). When administered—ideally via intravitreal injection to bypass the restrictive BRB—eculizumab is expected to achieve retinal therapeutic concentrations sufficient to block C5 cleavage effectively (Hammadi et al., 2023; Ong et al., 2024).
Specifically, by inhibiting the formation of C5a, eculizumab is anticipated to reduce the priming of the NLRP3 inflammasome within RPE cells. In vitro studies have demonstrated that C5a is a potent trigger for inflammasome activation, leading to caspase-1 activation and the subsequent execution of inflammatory cell death (Brandstetter, 2016). Consequently, a decrease in C5a levels would theoretically lead to a reduction in inflammasome activity, thereby limiting RPE pyroptosis and preserving cellular function.
Simultaneously, the blockade of C5b formation prevents the downstream assembly of the MAC, which has been implicated in RPE damage through both lytic and sublytic mechanisms (Armento et al., 2021; Holz et al., 2014). By averting MAC deposition, eculizumab could protect RPE cells from complement-mediated membrane damage that otherwise exacerbates cellular dysfunction and promotes the progression of GA.
In addition to these direct effects, the inhibition of terminal complement activation is also expected to indirectly stabilize the autophagic–lysosomal pathway in RPE cells. Under conditions of complement overactivation, the disruption of autophagy can lead to inefficient clearance of POS, resulting in the accumulation of debris and the formation of drusen—a key early step in the pathogenesis of dry AMD (Armento et al., 2021). By preserving autophagic flux, eculizumab may help to maintain the phagocytic function of RPE cells, ensuring that POS are efficiently cleared, thereby reducing the risk of toxic accumulation and further RPE stress (Armento et al., 2021).
A further expected benefit relates to the maintenance of MerTK-dependent signaling. RPE cells rely on MerTK for the recognition and phagocytosis of shed photoreceptor debris; damage to this pathway has been linked to compromised POS clearance and the exacerbation of retinal degeneration. By mitigating complement-mediated injury through C5 inhibition, eculizumab may help to preserve MerTK function, thus contributing to overall retinal homeostasis (Armento et al., 2021).
Preclinical models have underscored that targeted complement inhibition can lead to decreased markers of inflammation and reduced cell death in the retina. Although the COMPLETE clinical trial with systemic eculizumab did not achieve a statistically significant impact on GA lesion progression—most likely due to inadequate retinal drug exposure owing to the BRB—it provides a proof-of-concept that targeting C5 affects key pathological pathways (Halawa et al., 2021). Intravitreal administration is posited as an approach to achieve direct drug delivery to the RPE and retina, thereby enabling a more pronounced pharmacodynamic effect that would manifest as a stabilization or slowing of GA progression as measurable by imaging endpoints and functional tests (Hammadi et al., 2023; Ong et al., 2024).

Overall Evaluation
The prospect of repurposing eculizumab for dry AMD arises from a strong molecular and genetic rationale that places complement dysregulation—a key driver of inflammation, RPE cell death, and impaired retinal clearance—at the heart of the disease’s pathogenesis (Armento et al., 2021; Brandstetter, 2016). One of the major strengths of eculizumab is its robust mechanism of action. Through high-affinity binding to complement component C5, it effectively prevents its cleavage into the pro-inflammatory fragments C5a and C5b, thereby halting the generation of both inflammatory mediators and the membrane attack complex (MAC) (Armento et al., 2021; Brandstetter, 2016). This targeted inhibition directly addresses the cascade of events implicated in RPE dysfunction in dry AMD, including inflammasome activation and subsequent pyroptosis.
Another considerable strength is the established clinical safety and regulatory approval of eculizumab in systemic complement-mediated diseases such as PNH and aHUS. The wealth of safety data derived from its use in these severe conditions reduces the developmental risk when repurposing the agent for retinal disease indications. Moreover, the existing manufacturing infrastructure and quality control measures, honed over years of clinical use, facilitate a streamlined path toward regulatory approval in a new therapeutic area (Bandello et al., 2017; Mata & Vogel, 2010).
However, significant challenges remain that temper enthusiasm for the straightforward repurposing of eculizumab in dry AMD. Foremost among these is the issue of drug delivery. The blood-retina barrier (BRB) has repeatedly been implicated as a major obstacle to achieving therapeutic retinal concentrations when eculizumab is administered systemically, as observed in the COMPLETE trial where systemic dosing did not yield sufficient retinal drug exposure to impact GA progression (Halawa et al., 2021; Ong et al., 2024). Intravitreal injection has been proposed as a means to circumvent this limitation, yet such an approach is associated with its own risks, including ocular infection, inflammation, and the inherent burden of repeated intravitreal injections, particularly for a chronic, slowly progressive disease like dry AMD (Bandello et al., 2017; Hammadi et al., 2023).
Furthermore, it is important to acknowledge the multifactorial nature of dry AMD pathogenesis. While complement activation plays a substantial role, other factors such as oxidative stress, lipid dysregulation, and genetic predispositions (for instance, mutations in complement factor H) also contribute to disease progression (Dascalu et al., 2024; Holz et al., 2014). This implies that a monotherapy approach focused solely on C5 inhibition may not be sufficient to halt disease progression in all patients. There exists the possibility of redundancy within the complement system or compensatory activation of parallel inflammatory pathways that could undermine the therapeutic effect of eculizumab (Dascalu et al., 2024).
The economic aspect is another consideration. Eculizumab is among the most expensive biologics on the market. Its cost-effectiveness, particularly in a disease with a large patient population like dry AMD, is a substantive challenge that must be addressed if widespread adoption is to be achieved. High treatment costs combined with the need for repeated intravitreal dosing could create barriers both to patient compliance and to reimbursement by healthcare systems (Bandello et al., 2017).
From a broader strategic perspective, the clinical development of eculizumab for dry AMD may benefit from a combination therapy approach. Given the multifactorial etiology of dry AMD, pairing complement inhibition with agents that target oxidative stress or metabolic dysregulation could provide a synergistic effect that enhances overall efficacy. Such combination regimens may offer broader protection by simultaneously addressing multiple pathogenic pathways driving retinal degeneration (Dascalu et al., 2024; Holz et al., 2014).
On the other hand, the robust molecular rationale—that elevated complement C5a drives NLRP3 inflammasome activation and subsequent RPE cell death—is one of the strongest arguments in favor of pursuing complement inhibition as a therapeutic strategy (Brandstetter, 2016). If intravitreal administration of eculizumab can be optimized to achieve and sustain therapeutic drug levels in the retinal tissue, then the blockade of terminal complement activation could feasibly reduce inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis and improve critical cellular functions such as autophagic clearance of POS and MerTK signaling (Armento et al., 2021; Ong et al., 2024). Early-phase clinical studies that incorporate biomarker endpoints, such as reduced levels of C5a, diminished MAC deposition, and lowered inflammasome activity in RPE cells, will be essential in confirming that the drug’s mechanisms are effectively engaged at the target site (Hammadi et al., 2023).
In summary, while systemic clinical trials of eculizumab in GA have not met efficacy endpoints, likely due to challenges with retinal drug delivery, the agent remains a promising candidate from a mechanistic standpoint. Its potent inhibition of C5 and the consequent reduction in both inflammatory mediators and cytolytic complexes directly targets processes implicated in RPE cell death and retinal degeneration in dry AMD. The established safety profile and clinical experience from its use in systemic disorders further strengthen the case for its repurposing, provided that delivery challenges can be addressed.
Looking ahead, the optimal development strategy for eculizumab in dry AMD may involve:
1. Development and validation of an intravitreal formulation that ensures sustained, therapeutic concentrations in the retina while minimizing the frequency of injections.
2. Incorporation of robust biomarker endpoints in early-phase clinical trials to verify that complement inhibition, specifically the blockade of C5a generation and MAC formation, is achieved in the retinal compartment (Hammadi et al., 2023).
3. Consideration of combination therapies that target additional pathogenic mechanisms in dry AMD, such as oxidative stress or dysregulated lipid metabolism, to provide a more comprehensive treatment approach (Dascalu et al., 2024; Holz et al., 2014).
4. Patient stratification based on genetic markers of complement dysregulation to identify subgroups that may derive the most benefit from complement inhibition.
Overall, eculizumab’s potential for repurposing in dry AMD is supported by a compelling molecular rationale and substantial preclinical evidence linking complement overactivation to RPE degeneration (Armento et al., 2021; Brandstetter, 2016). However, its clinical success in this indication will depend critically on overcoming the significant challenges posed by drug delivery to the retina and the multifaceted nature of dry AMD pathogenesis. Continued research in optimizing intravitreal formulations, refining dosing regimens, and potentially combining complement inhibition with other therapeutic modalities will be pivotal steps in determining whether eculizumab can be effectively repositioned as a treatment for this currently intractable ocular disorder (Halawa et al., 2021; Ong et al., 2024).
Given the current state of evidence, further investigation is warranted. Although systemic administration of eculizumab has not demonstrated efficacy in slowing GA progression, the promising mechanistic insights—specifically, its ability to reduce NLRP3 inflammasome priming and prevent MAC-mediated RPE injury—suggest that an intravitreal approach merits further exploration. Future clinical trials should be carefully designed to assess both anatomical and functional outcomes, while also evaluating patient-reported measures of visual function over extended follow-up periods. Such studies will be critical for establishing the therapeutic window, safety profile, and long-term efficacy of eculizumab in dry AMD.
In conclusion, the repurposing of eculizumab for dry AMD has strong potential from a mechanistic and biochemical standpoint. The data linking excessive complement activation, particularly elevated C5a levels, to RPE inflammasome activation and subsequent cell death provide a clear rationale for targeting C5. Nevertheless, clinical translation remains challenging primarily due to issues related to the blood-retina barrier and the inherent complexity of dry AMD pathogenesis. With advanced drug delivery strategies—most notably, the development of an intravitreal formulation—and the incorporation of combination treatment strategies that address other aspects of the disease, eculizumab could ultimately play a meaningful role in a multifaceted therapeutic regimen aimed at preserving retinal integrity and visual function in patients with dry AMD (Armento et al., 2021; Hammadi et al., 2023; Ong et al., 2024). Further detailed and methodologically rigorous clinical investigations will be essential to fully ascertain its clinical utility in this challenging indication (Halawa et al., 2021; Ong et al., 2024).
