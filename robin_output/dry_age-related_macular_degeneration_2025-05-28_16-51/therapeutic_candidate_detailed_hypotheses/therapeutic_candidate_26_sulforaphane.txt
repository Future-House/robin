Proposal for Sulforaphane (Sigma-Aldrich Cat# S4441)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Sulforaphane is a naturally occurring isothiocyanate that was originally discovered in cruciferous vegetables—most notably broccoli—and has since been isolated, characterized, and made available commercially (Sigma-Aldrich Cat# S4441). It belongs to a class of phytochemicals that are known for their potent antioxidant properties. These bioactive compounds have been traditionally recognized as chemopreventive agents due to their ability to induce the expression of cytoprotective enzymes via modulation of cellular signaling pathways. Sulforaphane is synthesized naturally from glucosinolates present in cruciferous vegetables through the enzymatic action of myrosinase, and its biological activity has been validated in numerous preclinical studies. Historically, compounds of this class have been utilized in dietary interventions and nutraceutical formulations for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits, particularly in the prevention of cancer and in the attenuation of chronic degenerative processes associated with oxidative stress (Hernández-Rabaza, López-Pedrajas, & Almansa, 2019; Yang et al., 2021).

Therapeutic History:
Over the past few decades, sulforaphane has been extensively studied in both in vitro and in vivo models. Early work demonstrated its capacity to induce phase II detoxification enzymes in hepatic and non-hepatic tissues, laying the groundwork for its classification as an indirect antioxidant. In retinal systems, numerous preclinical studies have investigated sulforaphane’s effects on retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, specifically using ARPE-19 as a model system. These studies have shown that sulforaphane can mitigate oxidative stress–induced damage by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, upregulating critical antioxidant enzymes such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and the glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit (GCLM), and thereby reducing the accumulation of oxidative byproducts like lipofuscin (Boulton, 2022; Yang et al., 2021). Although no clinical trials have been reported specifically for dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) or retinal conditions according to recent clinical trial searches (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), the biochemical literature and animal studies have consistently demonstrated promising cytoprotective properties of sulforaphane in retinal tissue models. In addition, rodent models subjected to retinal ischemia-reperfusion injury have shown that sulforaphane pre-treatment preserves retinal structure and function by activating NRF2-mediated antioxidant pathways (Pan et al., 2014). This history of use in various models of oxidative stress–induced retinal degeneration underpins the rationale for repurposing sulforaphane as a potential drug candidate for dry AMD.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, sulforaphane’s primary mechanism of action is through the activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (NRF2) signaling pathway. Under basal conditions, NRF2 is sequestered in the cytoplasm by Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), which targets NRF2 for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Sulforaphane, being an electrophilic molecule, covalently modifies critical cysteine residues on KEAP1. This modification disrupts the KEAP1–NRF2 interaction, thereby preventing NRF2 degradation. As a consequence, NRF2 stabilizes, accumulates, and translocates to the nucleus where it dimerizes with small Maf proteins and binds antioxidant response elements (ARE) located within the promoter regions of its target genes (Chen, Zhao, Sternberg, & Cai, 2012; Chang, Lin, Yang, & Yang, 2020).

Once activated, NRF2 upregulates the transcription of a battery of phase II detoxification enzymes and antioxidant proteins, including heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and the glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit (GCLM). HO-1 catalyzes the degradation of heme into biliverdin, carbon monoxide, and free iron, a process that has both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory implications. NQO1 acts to reduce quinones, preventing redox cycling and subsequent ROS generation, while GCLM is essential for the synthesis of glutathione (GSH), the major intracellular antioxidant that plays a pivotal role in detoxifying ROS (Boulton, 2022; Catanzaro et al., 2020; Cui et al., 2020). In ARPE-19 cells, sulforaphane has been repeatedly shown to stimulate NRF2 nuclear translocation and enhance the expression of these critical enzymes, resulting in a robust antioxidant response that attenuates oxidative stress.

Beyond the upregulation of antioxidant defenses, sulforaphane is suggested to preserve lysosomal enzymatic activity and maintain cellular proteostasis. By mitigating oxidative damage, it is believed that sulforaphane indirectly supports lysosomal integrity, which is crucial for the phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) by RPE cells. Efficient lysosomal function is necessary for the clearance of cellular debris and for preventing the accumulation of lipofuscin, a pigment that accumulates with age and is associated with dry AMD. Moreover, proper lysosomal function is essential for the Mer tyrosine kinase (MerTK)–mediated phagocytosis process, responsible for the ingestion and degradation of POS. Although direct evidence linking sulforaphane to increased MerTK-mediated phagocytosis is sparse, the indirect support stemming from enhanced antioxidant capacity and lysosomal preservation offers a plausible mechanism by which sulforaphane could restore phagocytic function in RPE cells (Catanzaro et al., 2020; Pan et al., 2014).

Expected Effect:
Based on the extensive biochemical and in vivo data, the expected effect of sulforaphane on RPE cells is multifaceted. First, sulforaphane will activate NRF2 via covalent modification of KEAP1. This activation will lead to the upregulation of phase II detoxification enzymes, particularly HO-1, NQO1, and GCLM, in ARPE-19 cells, which have been well characterized in several studies (Boulton, 2022; Yang et al., 2021). As these enzymes increase the cellular antioxidant capacity, a reduction in ROS levels and a concomitant decrease in lipofuscin formation are expected. In the context of dry AMD, where oxidative stress and lipofuscin accumulation drive RPE dysfunction and degeneration, these effects are therapeutically desirable. Second, improved redox homeostasis is anticipated to preserve lysosomal enzymatic activity. While lysosomal preservation has been indirectly linked to NRF2 activation through improved antioxidant defenses, the reduction of oxidative damage to lysosomal membranes should, in theory, enhance the ability of RPE cells to degrade phagocytosed photoreceptor outer segments (Pan et al., 2014; Catanzaro et al., 2020). This preservation of lysosomal function is critical because it is a prerequisite for efficient MerTK-mediated phagocytosis, a receptor-mediated process by which RPE cells clear shed photoreceptor outer segments. Although direct measurements of MerTK-mediated ingestion under sulforaphane treatment are limited, the overall increase in cellular detoxification and antioxidant defense provides a strong mechanistic basis for expecting restoration or improvement in this phagocytic process (Catanzaro et al., 2020; Cui et al., 2020).

In an assay using ARPE-19 cells, for example, we would expect sulforaphane treatment to lead to measurable increases in the expression levels of HO-1, NQO1, and GCLM mRNA and protein. Concomitantly, assays measuring intracellular ROS, mitochondrial membrane potential, and markers of lipid peroxidation should show significant improvement relative to controls exposed to oxidative stress alone. In functional assays, preservation of lysosomal enzyme activities should correlate with enhanced clearance of POS-like substrates by RPE cells, potentially demonstrable by increased uptake and degradation in a MerTK-dependent assay (Yang et al., 2021; Hernández-Rabaza et al., 2019).

Overall Evaluation:
Sulforaphane represents a highly promising therapeutic candidate for dry AMD, owing to its well-documented mechanism of activating the NRF2 pathway, which is crucial for elevating endogenous antioxidant defenses. Strengths of sulforaphane include its natural origin, which confers a generally favorable safety profile, and its potent biochemical activity in upregulating phase II detoxification enzymes. The literature provides robust evidence for its ability to reduce oxidative stress, enhance mitochondrial and cellular redox homeostasis, and potentially preserve lysosomal function in RPE cells (Boulton, 2022; Catanzaro et al., 2020). These effects are directly relevant to the pathogenesis of dry AMD, where oxidative damage leads to RPE dysfunction, lipofuscin accumulation, and impaired phagocytosis. Moreover, the therapeutic hypothesis that sulforaphane can secondarily restore MerTK-mediated phagocytosis by maintaining lysosomal integrity presents an attractive strategy to counteract the accumulation of photoreceptor debris—a key feature of dry AMD pathology (Pan et al., 2014; Canto et al., 2022).

However, some weaknesses must also be considered. Although in vitro and animal studies consistently demonstrate sulforaphane’s NRF2 activation and antioxidant effects, there is a lack of direct clinical data or human trials targeting AMD specifically (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In addition, while the preservation of lysosomal function and improvement in MerTK-mediated phagocytosis are mechanistically plausible, the evidence for these effects remains largely indirect. Further research, particularly translational studies, is needed to clearly define the impact of sulforaphane on lysosomal enzyme activity and phagocytic capacity in the context of dry AMD (Catanzaro et al., 2020; Cui et al., 2020). Moreover, formulation and delivery remain key challenges for ocular drugs; however, recent data suggesting that topical delivery can yield therapeutic ocular levels of sulforaphane are encouraging (Bergandi et al., 2024).

In summary, the overall evaluation of sulforaphane is positive. Its strengths—rooted in a well-characterized mechanism of NRF2 activation, induction of endogenous detoxifying enzymes, reduction in oxidative stress, and potential to restore critical RPE functions—support its further investigation as a repurposed drug candidate for dry AMD. Weaknesses such as the need for more direct evidence on lysosomal preservation and MerTK-mediated phagocytosis, as well as the absence of clinical trial data specific to AMD, suggest that additional preclinical studies are warranted. Nonetheless, given its broad cytoprotective effects and minimal known toxicity, sulforaphane remains an attractive candidate that could offer a multifaceted therapeutic approach to mitigating RPE degeneration and counteracting the progression of dry AMD (Hernández-Rabaza et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2023).
