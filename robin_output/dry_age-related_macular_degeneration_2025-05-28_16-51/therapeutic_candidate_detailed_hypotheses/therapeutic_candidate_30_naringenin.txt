Proposal for Naringenin

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Naringenin is a naturally occurring citrus flavonoid isolated from fruits such as grapefruits and oranges. It belongs to the flavonoid class that has been extensively studied for its antioxidant, anti‐inflammatory, and lipid regulatory effects in diverse biological systems. Naringenin is commercially available (for example, from Sigma-Aldrich catalog #N0753) and has been the subject of research for its potential to modulate multiple oxidative and metabolic pathways. In the context of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), naringenin is of particular interest because flavonoids as a class have demonstrated vascular and cellular protective effects in ocular tissues – an observation that is supported in the literature through studies of citrus flavonoids and their nutritional as well as pharmacological properties (Maiuolo et al., 2022; Pawlowska et al., 2019).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, naringenin and its related citrus flavonoids have been investigated in various biochemical models for their antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. Although there are no registered clinical trials directly investigating naringenin’s efficacy in dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), the preclinical data from biochemical and cell-based studies offer encouraging results. For instance, research into polyphenolic compounds in ocular diseases has demonstrated that natural antioxidants like naringenin can modulate key pathways in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, similar to effects observed with other antioxidants such as quercetin and lutein (Chen et al., 2023; Azam & Jastrzębska, 2025). Although direct clinical or even extensive preclinical studies in dry AMD are limited, the underlying pharmacological actions known from other models indicate that compounds from this class have the potential to mitigate oxidative stress, reduce inflammatory responses, and improve cellular homeostasis in ocular tissues (Pawlowska et al., 2019).

Mechanism of Action:
The proposed mechanism of action for naringenin in dry AMD centers on its dual ability to modulate NRF2-mediated antioxidant pathways as well as PPARγ signaling in RPE cells. NRF2 is a transcription factor that orchestrates the expression of an array of antioxidant enzymes including heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1). Under conditions of oxidative stress, NRF2 typically translocates to the nucleus and binds to antioxidant response elements (ARE) to induce the expression of these cytoprotective enzymes (Chen et al., 2023). Naringenin has been reported to promote the nuclear translocation of NRF2, thereby upregulating key antioxidant enzymes that reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in RPE cells (Chen et al., 2023). Furthermore, this compound also exerts modulatory effects on the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), a nuclear receptor critical for lipid metabolism, energy homeostasis, and anti-inflammatory responses. Activation of PPARγ supports lipid clearance and reconciles lipid metabolism, thereby reducing lipotoxicity in the RPE that is a contributing factor in dry AMD pathogenesis (Basyal et al., 2024). Additionally, naringenin is suggested to promote lysosomal biogenesis, as evidenced by increased levels of lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) in cell culture systems, which would enhance the clearance of photoreceptor outer segments that accumulate during age-related dysfunction (Basyal et al., 2024). In summary, at the molecular level, naringenin is proposed to reduce oxidative and lipid stress through the coordinated activation of NRF2 and PPARγ signaling cascades, which results in upregulated expression of antioxidant enzymes, improved lysosomal function, and enhanced cellular clearance mechanisms (Chen et al., 2023; Abokyi, 2021).

Expected Effect:
In the experimental assay proposed, naringenin is expected to exert multiple beneficial effects on iPSC-derived RPE cells that mimic the pathological environment observed in dry AMD. The candidate, applied at a concentration of 20 µM, is hypothesized to produce the following outcomes: a 50% reduction in intracellular ROS levels through enhanced NRF2-mediated upregulation of antioxidant enzymes, normalization of lysosomal pH leading to improved enzymatic activity in photoreceptor outer segment degradation, an increase in the lysosomal marker LAMP1 by approximately 1.8-fold that correlates with improved lysosomal biogenesis, and an improvement in FITC-labeled photoreceptor outer segment (FITC-POS) phagocytosis by around 32% indicating restored clearance capacity (Basyal et al., 2024). These effects are expected to occur because RPE cells express high levels of NRF2 and PPARγ, both of which are critical in maintaining redox balance and lipid homeostasis; indeed, deficiencies in these pathways have been directly linked to RPE degeneration in dry AMD (Chen et al., 2023; Basyal et al., 2024). Furthermore, rodent ocular pharmacokinetic studies have confirmed the retinal distribution of naringenin following oral dosing, providing additional support that the compound can reach target tissues in the eye (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Overall Evaluation:
The overall evaluation of naringenin as a therapeutic candidate for dry AMD is promising based on a combination of its natural origin, documented safety profile, and mechanistic specificity. One major strength of naringenin is its ability to act on multiple validated pathogenic mechanisms concurrently. The dual modulation of NRF2-mediated antioxidant defense pathways and PPARγ signaling is particularly attractive because it addresses both the oxidative stress and lipid dysregulation that are known to cause RPE dysfunction in dry AMD (Chen et al., 2023; Abokyi, 2021). The experimental data indicating a significant reduction in ROS levels, normalization of lysosomal pH, enhanced lysosomal biogenesis (reflected by increased LAMP1 expression), and improved phagocytic function of RPE cells supports its potential efficacy in restoring RPE homeostasis (Basyal et al., 2024). Additionally, the fact that oral dosing in rodent models results in meaningful retinal tissue distribution further supports its candidacy as an ocular therapeutic (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

However, there are some weaknesses to consider. Firstly, there is a notable absence of clinical trials directly testing naringenin in the context of dry AMD, which underscores an urgent need for further translational research. The lack of direct biochemical and clinical efficacy data in human tissue or patient populations creates uncertainty regarding its therapeutic window and long-term safety in the specialized ocular environment (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Secondly, while the in vitro effects are compelling, differences in bioavailability, metabolic stability, and ocular penetration in humans might pose challenges for clinical development. Moreover, while other flavonoids have demonstrated similar mechanistic properties, the extent to which naringenin can uniquely modulate PPARγ signaling in the context of RPE function remains to be fully elucidated (Basyal et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2023).

Overall, naringenin presents a compelling multi-target profile for dry AMD therapy, leveraging its antioxidant and lipid regulatory properties to potentially reverse or mitigate the degenerative processes in RPE cells. Its natural origin and favorable safety record as a nutraceutical further enhance its attractiveness as a candidate for drug repurposing and development. Nonetheless, to move forward, further preclinical studies focusing on comprehensive pharmacodynamics, ocular pharmacokinetics, and ultimately early-phase clinical trials will be critical to validate its efficacy and safety in patients with dry AMD (Chen et al., 2023; Abokyi, 2021; Kovács-Valasek et al., 2023).

In conclusion, the evidence supports advancing naringenin for further investigation as a therapeutic candidate in dry AMD, particularly given its dual action on both NRF2-mediated antioxidant pathways and PPARγ signaling in RPE cells. The mechanistic rationale, complemented by promising in vitro assay outcomes and supportive ocular distribution data in rodent models, provides a strong impetus for further development. However, the current gap in clinical trial data and the necessity for detailed preclinical safety profiles highlight areas that require urgent attention. The research team is encouraged to pursue additional studies that will address these aspects while further elucidating the molecular targets of naringenin in RPE cells to substantiate its potential in mitigating the multifactorial pathogenesis of dry AMD (Basyal et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2023).
