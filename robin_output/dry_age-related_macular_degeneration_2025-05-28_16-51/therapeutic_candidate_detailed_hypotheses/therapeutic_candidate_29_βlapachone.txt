Proposal for β-Lapachone (NQO1 substrate; Santa Cruz Cat# sc-204290)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
β‐Lapachone is a naturally derived naphthoquinone originally isolated from the bark of the lapacho tree (Tabebuia species), making it a natural product rather than a purely synthetic chemical. It belongs to the quinone class of therapeutic compounds, a group known for their reversible redox properties and ability to undergo bioactivation by enzymes such as NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1). Quinones have been widely explored for their anticancer, anti‐inflammatory, and cytoprotective activities in diverse biomedical contexts, and β‐lapachone specifically is recognized for its anticancer prodrug properties. Its identification and subsequent development have relied on its unique chemical structure—which allows a two‐electron reduction by NQO1, initiating a futile redox cycle—and its capacity to alter intracellular NAD^+/NADH balance, a mechanism that underlies its potential therapeutic uses (Park et al., 2014; Feng, 2021).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, β‐lapachone has been investigated primarily in the context of oncology as an anticancer agent due to its selective cytotoxicity in NQO1‐overexpressing tumor cells. Preclinical studies have demonstrated its efficacy by promoting reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and subsequent cell death in cancer models, exploiting the high levels of NQO1 found in certain tumors (Hayes, 2021). Beyond oncology, β‐lapachone’s pharmacological profile extends to its potential utility as an anti‐angiogenic agent, as evidenced by studies in oxygen‐induced retinopathy models where it was shown to inhibit pathological retinal neovascularization via regulation of hypoxia‐inducible factor‐1α (HIF‐1α) (Park et al., 2014). Although its use in dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) has not been established in clinical or veterinary settings to date, the biological underpinnings of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) dysfunction in dry AMD share common features with the pathological processes modulated by β‐lapachone, including impaired redox balance, mitochondrial dysfunction, and defective autophagy (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Furthermore, the quinone class—exemplified by compounds such as idebenone—has been used both preclinically and in certain clinical scenarios for retinal and neurodegenerative conditions, supporting the rationale for repurposing β‐lapachone for dry AMD (Feng, 2021).

Mechanism of Action:
The mechanistic basis for β‐lapachone’s proposed therapeutic effect relies on its bioactivation via the enzyme NQO1, which is highly expressed in various tissues including the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Upon reduction by NQO1, β‐lapachone participates in a redox cycle that consumes NADH or NADPH and rapidly regenerates NAD^+. This regeneration elevates the intracellular NAD^+/NADH ratio, a critical determinant for the activation of NAD^+-dependent enzymes such as sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). SIRT1, once activated, engages downstream signaling pathways such as AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which serves as an energy sensor and promotes mitochondrial biogenesis and lipid metabolism (Hayes, 2021; Feng, 2021). These pathways, in turn, stimulate autophagy—a catabolic process essential for clearing damaged proteins and organelles, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis. In RPE cells, enhanced autophagic flux may lead to improved lysosomal function and a reduction in lipofuscin accumulation, which is a hallmark of dry AMD. Beyond autophagy, the restoration of mitochondrial function via improved NAD^+ levels can help maintain energy homeostasis in metabolically active RPE cells. An additional proposed effect, albeit more indirect, is the stimulation of MerTK-driven phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments (POS). MerTK is a receptor tyrosine kinase critical for the clearance of POS, and its proper function is essential for RPE integrity and retinal homeostasis (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Thus, by engaging NQO1, β‐lapachone can potentially restore redox balance, activate SIRT1/AMPK signaling, and promote a cascade of cellular repair mechanisms that include improved autophagy and phagocytosis—mechanisms that are fundamentally impaired in dry AMD (Park et al., 2014; Feng, 2021).

Expected Effect:
In the context of dry age‐related macular degeneration, the therapeutic hypothesis is that β‐lapachone’s activation of NQO1 in RPE cells will boost NAD^+ regeneration and thereby enhance the activity of NAD^+-dependent deacetylases such as SIRT1. The activation of the SIRT1/AMPK axis is expected to lead to improved mitochondrial function and increased autophagic flux, which in turn would facilitate the clearance of damaged proteins and organelles, reducing the accumulation of lipofuscin. Lipofuscin buildup is a characteristic feature of dry AMD and is associated with impaired lysosomal degradation and cellular senescence in RPE cells. Additionally, by restoring cellular energy metabolism and redox balance, β‐lapachone may secondarily promote MerTK‐driven phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments, a process critical to maintaining retinal health and function. The expression of NQO1 in retinal and RPE cells further supports the potential of this approach, as these cells rely on efficient mitochondrial and lysosomal function to prevent degeneration (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Feng, 2021). Moreover, the literature indicates that some preclinical studies have explored oral and topical formulations of β‐lapachone to achieve sufficient ocular tissue levels, bolstering its candidacy as a drug repurposing candidate for ocular applications (Park et al., 2014; Tsang et al., 2019).

Overall Evaluation:
The overall evaluation of β‐lapachone as a therapeutic candidate for dry age‐related macular degeneration reveals several strengths, as well as challenges that warrant further investigation. One of the primary strengths lies in its mechanism of action; by targeting NQO1, β‐lapachone can induce a redox cycle that not only regenerates NAD^+ but also activates protective signaling pathways including SIRT1 and AMPK. These pathways are critical for the maintenance of mitochondrial and lysosomal function and have been implicated in the cellular pathology underlying dry AMD. The ability to improve autophagic flux carries significant promise, as defective autophagy is central to RPE dysfunction and subsequent photoreceptor degeneration in dry AMD (Feng, 2021; Hayes, 2021).

Another strength is the precedent within the quinone class for applications in diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, particularly in the retina. Compounds such as idebenone, which is structurally related to β‐lapachone, have already found use in some retinal and neurodegenerative conditions, suggesting that repurposing a quinone-based compound like β‐lapachone is a viable strategy (Feng, 2021).

However, there are notable weaknesses and uncertainties. Despite promising preclinical data in models of pathological retinal neovascularization, there is a paucity of direct evidence regarding β‐lapachone’s efficacy in treating dry AMD specifically. Most studies to date have focused on its anticancer and anti‐angiogenic effects rather than on RPE survival or autophagic restoration in the context of AMD (Park et al., 2014; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additionally, although the hypothesis regarding enhanced MerTK‐driven phagocytosis is intriguing, detailed mechanistic studies confirming this effect in RPE models are currently lacking.

Another challenge is the delivery and pharmacokinetic profile. While there are reports of both oral and topical formulations achieving therapeutic ocular levels, the effective concentration required for modulating NQO1 activity in RPE cells without causing off‐target effects or toxicity remains to be rigorously defined. Quinones, due to their redox activity, have the potential to generate ROS under specific conditions, which could be deleterious if not properly controlled; therefore, a fine balance must be achieved between beneficial NAD^+ regeneration and harmful oxidative stress (Hayes, 2021; Feng, 2021).

In summary, β‐lapachone represents a promising candidate for repurposing in dry age‐related macular degeneration owing to its unique mechanism of NQO1-mediated redox cycling, NAD^+ regeneration, and subsequent activation of cytoprotective pathways such as SIRT1/AMPK, which are critical for maintaining RPE cellular integrity and function. Its ability to potentially enhance autophagic flux and stimulate MerTK-driven phagocytosis further strengthens its candidacy. Nonetheless, the lack of direct evidence in dry AMD models, coupled with uncertainties regarding optimal dosing and potential oxidative risks, suggests that additional detailed preclinical studies are necessary. These studies should aim to elucidate the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of β‐lapachone in ocular tissues, confirm its effects on autophagy and phagocytosis in RPE cells, and establish a clear safety profile before progressing to clinical trials in dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Park et al., 2014; Feng, 2021).
