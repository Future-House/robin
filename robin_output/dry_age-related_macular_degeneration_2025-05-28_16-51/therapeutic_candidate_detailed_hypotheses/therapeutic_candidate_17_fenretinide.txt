Proposal for Fenretinide (4-HPR)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Fenretinide (4-hydroxyphenyl retinamide or 4-HPR) is a synthetic retinoid derivative originally developed as an anticancer agent and later repurposed for diverse indications. It is structurally derived from vitamin A analogs and belongs to the class of retinoids, compounds known to modulate retinoid signaling pathways and affect cellular differentiation and apoptosis. Its synthesis involves chemical modifications of the retinoid backbone to enhance its pharmacokinetic profile and reduce side effects compared with natural retinoids. The classification of fenretinide as a retinoid positions it within a broader therapeutic category that has historically been used in oncology, dermatology (for conditions such as acne and psoriasis), and metabolic disorders. Researchers have also recognized its potential to modulate retinol transport by binding to retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4), a key serum protein responsible for the mobilization of vitamin A from hepatic stores to peripheral tissues including the retina. This mechanism lays the foundation for exploiting fenretinide in retinal degenerative diseases in which excess retinol flux may lead to the formation of toxic bisretinoid byproducts in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
Fenretinide’s therapeutic journey began in the late 1960s when it was synthesized and tested as an anticancer compound, particularly in breast cancer chemoprevention, where its cytotoxic properties were exploited at relatively high concentrations. Over time, its relatively favorable toxicity profile when compared with other retinoids—as evidenced by minimal liver accumulation and tissue-specific deposition primarily in the mammary gland—prompted investigations into its chemopreventive and metabolic effects (Potenza et al., 2022). Beyond oncology, fenretinide has been evaluated for its beneficial metabolic properties, including improvements in insulin sensitivity through effects on ceramide biosynthesis and oxidative stress pathways. Preclinical studies demonstrated that fenretinide reduced circulating RBP4 levels and consequently lowered serum retinol levels, which was associated with beneficial effects in rodent models of obesity and insulin resistance (Gutierrez, 2017).

In relation to ocular diseases, fenretinide was repurposed based on the hypothesis that lowering systemic retinol levels could reduce the substrate available for the formation of toxic bisretinoids such as A2E. Its use has been evaluated in preclinical animal models, notably in Abca4−/− mice—a model for Stargardt disease and one that exhibits enhanced bisretinoid accumulation—where administration of fenretinide resulted in a 45% reduction in retinal A2E levels (Al Breiki, 2020). Additionally, some phase 2 clinical investigations in patients with geographic atrophy, a late-stage form of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), have been performed. These studies provided evidence that oral administration of fenretinide was generally well tolerated and even demonstrated a reduction in lipofuscin autofluorescence on fundus autofluorescence imaging, although the clinical endpoints related to lesion growth and visual acuity were mixed (Eaton, 2005; Danis et al., 2015). Moreover, early studies in related conditions such as Stargardt disease suggested that fenretinide might have similar effects on reducing lipofuscin accumulation, lending further support to the proposition that its mechanism could be beneficial in dry AMD as well (Al Breiki, 2020; Fabre et al., 2022).

Mechanism of Action:
The primary mechanistic rationale for using fenretinide in dry AMD centers on the modulation of retinol metabolism and the consequent reduction of toxic bisretinoid accumulation in the RPE. Under normal physiological conditions, retinol (vitamin A) is transported in the bloodstream bound to retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4), which, in turn, forms a complex with transthyretin (TTR) to maintain its stability and facilitate its delivery to peripheral tissues such as the retina (Golczak et al., 2008; Unknown Reference). Fenretinide binds with high affinity to RBP4, competing with natural retinol and thereby destabilizing the RBP4–TTR complex. This competitive binding promotes rapid urinary clearance of the fenretinide–RBP4 complex, leading to a decrease in circulating retinol levels (Hussain et al., 2018; Petrukhin, 2013). With less retinol available for uptake by the RPE, the substrate required for the formation of cytotoxic bisretinoids—especially A2E—is diminished. A2E is a major component of lipofuscin that accumulates in the RPE and has been linked to lysosomal dysfunction, cellular stress, and impaired clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

At the molecular level, fenretinide’s mechanism involves multiple biochemical interactions. First, its RBP4 antagonism decreases retinol supply to the RPE, thereby reducing the formation of bisretinoids that result from the condensation of retinaldehyde with phosphatidylethanolamine. Studies have indicated that by lowering the substrate concentration for these reactions, fenretinide indirectly reduces the rate of toxic A2E accumulation in RPE cells (Unknown Reference; Gutierrez, 2017). Additionally, fenretinide may have a weak inhibitory effect on the visual cycle enzyme RPE65, thereby further modulating the rate of chromophore regeneration; however, it primarily acts through the reduction of systemic retinol rather than direct enzyme inhibition (Petrukhin, 2013; Hussain et al., 2018).

Another aspect of fenretinide’s molecular action is its potential interaction with nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RARs), particularly RARα. While fenretinide exhibits agonistic properties at these receptors—leading to apoptosis in certain cancer cells—this activity is not considered central to its utility in retinal diseases and may contribute to some of its adverse effect profiles (Dobri et al., 2013; Potenza et al., 2022). Consequently, its beneficial ocular effects are attributed more specifically to its ability to reduce retinol availability rather than to alterations in gene expression mediated by RAR activation. Furthermore, fenretinide’s impact on enzymes involved in lipid metabolism such as stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) has been documented, although the relevance of this to dry AMD is secondary compared to its retinol-lowering action (Gutierrez, 2017; Petrukhin, 2013).

In summary, fenretinide’s biochemical mechanism comprises (1) competitive binding to RBP4 to reduce serum and ocular retinol levels, (2) indirect limitation of bisretinoid (e.g., A2E) formation in the RPE, and (3) modulation of visual cycle kinetics with a potential, albeit modest, effect on RPE65 activity. These molecular interactions have been substantiated by in vitro studies and animal models, including Abca4−/− mice where fenretinide administration lowered A2E levels by approximately 45% (Al Breiki, 2020; Gutierrez, 2017).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis for using fenretinide in dry AMD is founded on the premise that excessive retinol flux into the RPE contributes to the pathological accumulation of bisretinoid compounds, notably A2E. In the intended assay, treatment with fenretinide is expected to lower circulating retinol levels by disrupting the RBP4–TTR complex, thereby reducing the delivery of retinol to the RPE. With reduced availability of the vitamin A substrate, the subsequent synthesis of bisretinoids would be decreased. Preclinical evidence from Abca4−/− mouse models has shown that fenretinide treatment results in a significant reduction (approximately 45%) of retinal A2E accumulation and an improvement in the efficiency of photoreceptor outer segment (POS) clearance by up to 25% (Al Breiki, 2020; Guimaraes et al., 2022).

In the context of dry AMD, where lipofuscin accumulation in the RPE leads to lysosomal overload and impaired autophagy, the expected pharmacological action of fenretinide would be to alleviate these pathogenic processes. By lowering retinol levels, fenretinide reduces the substrate for A2E formation, thereby lessening lipofuscin buildup. In turn, this should promote improved phagolysosomal digestion of POS, a process that is compromised in dry AMD. The improvement in RPE phagocytic function is crucial because the timely clearance of POS is essential to maintaining photoreceptor health and preventing degenerative changes in the retina (Danis et al., 2015; Eaton, 2005).

At a cellular level, fenretinide is anticipated to act within the RPE cells that are known to express various components of the retinoid processing machinery, including RBP4 receptors and visual cycle enzymes such as RPE65. The reduction in bisretinoid accumulation is posited to decrease phototoxic stress and oxidative damage, thereby preserving RPE cell integrity and function. This mechanism is supported by clinical imaging findings, where a decrease in lipofuscin autofluorescence has been observed, indicating a reduction in bisretinoid load that could translate to a slowdown in disease progression (Fabre et al., 2022; Unknown Reference).

Furthermore, by mitigating the retinol-induced overload of bisretinoids and correcting lysosomal dysfunction, fenretinide may indirectly support a more effective autophagic clearance process. This is particularly important in dry AMD, where compromised autophagy in the RPE contributes to ongoing tissue degeneration and chronic inflammation. Collectively, the expected biochemical and cellular effects—lowered serum retinol, diminished bisretinoid (A2E) synthesis, improved lysosomal degradation, and enhanced POS clearance—build a comprehensive rationale for fenretinide’s potential benefit as a disease-modifying agent in dry AMD (Hussain et al., 2018; Gutierrez, 2017).

Overall Evaluation:
Fenretinide presents as a promising therapeutic candidate for dry age-related macular degeneration based on its defined biochemical mechanism, preclinical efficacy, and repurposing potential. One of its major strengths is the clear mechanistic rationale: by binding to RBP4, fenretinide effectively reduces circulating retinol levels, which in turn decreases the substrate available for the formation of toxic bisretinoids like A2E. This targeted approach addresses a validated metabolic contributor to dry AMD pathogenesis—namely, the accumulation of lipofuscin in the RPE that leads to lysosomal dysfunction and impaired clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (Golczak et al., 2008; Unknown Reference).

Another strength is the supportive preclinical evidence, notably in animal models such as the Abca4−/− mice, where fenretinide administration resulted in a measurable reduction of A2E buildup (approximately 45%) and improvements in phagolysosomal clearance of photoreceptor debris by up to 25% (Al Breiki, 2020). This evidence is further complemented by early-phase clinical trials in geographic atrophy, which have shown tolerable safety profiles and some indication of reduced lipofuscin accumulation on fundus autofluorescence imaging (Eaton, 2005; Danis et al., 2015).

However, there are also weaknesses and challenges to consider. The clinical efficacy of fenretinide in dry AMD remains mixed. While the biochemical rationale is robust, some clinical trials have not demonstrated a statistically significant effect on slowing geographic atrophy lesion growth or improving visual acuity. For example, although reductions in serum RBP4 were observed and there was some correlation with lesion growth slowdown, the effect sizes in human trials have been modest and inconsistent (Wright & Ambati, 2017; Hussain et al., 2018). Additionally, fenretinide’s retinoid properties entail the risk of side effects commonly seen with vitamin A derivatives, such as delayed dark adaptation and possible induction of apoptosis in RPE cells. Its agonistic activity on retinoic acid receptors (RARs) might contribute to adverse ocular events and systemic toxicity, which could limit its therapeutic window (Dobri et al., 2013; Potenza et al., 2022).

Another consideration is the complexity of dry AMD pathogenesis itself. Although bisretinoid accumulation is a key factor, recent studies have questioned the direct causal role of A2E and lipofuscin in driving lesion progression, suggesting that targeting retinol metabolism alone might be insufficient to provide meaningful clinical benefit (Wright & Ambati, 2017; Shah et al., 2019). This implies that while fenretinide’s mechanism may address one pathological pathway, a more comprehensive therapeutic approach—possibly involving combination therapies that target inflammation, oxidative stress, and neuroprotection—might be necessary for optimal treatment of dry AMD.

Furthermore, the achievement of adequate serum RBP4 reduction appears critical for efficacy; clinical data indicate that only a subset of patients may attain the necessary level of RBP4 depletion (around 70% reduction) to see significant retardation of lesion growth (Petrukhin, 2013).

In terms of drug development strategy, fenretinide benefits from an extensive history of research across oncology and metabolic diseases that informs its pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles. Its repurposing for ocular indications leverages preexisting safety data from cancer trials and early-phase metabolic studies, which can expedite the clinical development timeline. However, the development pipeline for ocular indications such as dry AMD is highly competitive, and alternative agents—particularly non-retinoid RBP4 antagonists like A1120—are being evaluated with potentially improved safety profiles and fewer retinoid-associated side effects (Dobri et al., 2013; Plau, 2024).

Overall, fenretinide is a conceptually attractive candidate for repurposing in dry AMD due to its defined mechanism of reducing retinol-induced bisretinoid accumulation and its preclinical efficacy in models resembling human disease. Its strengths lie in the molecular rationale, positive preclinical findings, and established safety data from non-ocular indications. However, significant challenges remain regarding the translation of these effects to clinically meaningful outcomes, the potential for retinoid-related side effects, and the inherent heterogeneity in drug response among patients with dry AMD. These considerations suggest that while fenretinide warrants further investigation and could be incorporated as part of a combination therapy strategy, additional optimization—potentially through dose adjustments, alternative formulations, or the development of related compounds with improved specificity (such as non-retinoid RBP4 antagonists)—may be required to fully validate its therapeutic potential for dry AMD (Hussain et al., 2018; Fabre et al., 2022; Gutierrez, 2017).

In conclusion, based on the comprehensive review of biomedical, clinical, and biochemical literature, fenretinide demonstrates a promising mechanistic profile for addressing key pathogenic features of dry AMD through modulation of retinol transport and reduction of toxic bisretinoid accumulation. Its preclinical efficacy in reducing A2E levels and improving RPE phagocytic function supports the hypothesis that lowering circulating retinol can alleviate lysosomal overload and enhance photoreceptor outer segment clearance. Nonetheless, the clinical data to date have been mixed, and concerns regarding the drug’s retinoid-associated adverse effects and variability in patient response highlight the need for further targeted studies. The overall evaluation is cautiously optimistic: fenretinide represents a viable candidate for repurposing in dry AMD, with the potential to be most effective when used in combination with therapies that address additional aspects of the disease pathology (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Eaton, 2005; Danis et al., 2015).
