Proposal for Everolimus (RAD001)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Everolimus (RAD001) is a synthetic derivative of rapamycin that belongs to the class of mTOR inhibitors, specifically targeting mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1). It was originally isolated from Streptomyces hygroscopicus and later modified chemically by Novartis to improve its pharmacokinetic profile, solubility, and bioavailability. Everolimus is well characterized for its immunosuppressive and antiproliferative properties and has been approved for various indications such as organ transplantation and certain cancers, placing it among well‐established rapalogs that exert their effects by binding the intracellular protein FKBP12 and subsequently inhibiting mTORC1 activity (Walters & Cox, 2018). Its development history leverages decades of research into the mTOR pathway and the role of rapamycin analogs in modulating autophagy and cell growth, making it an attractive candidate for repurposing in chronic, age‐related diseases like dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic history of everolimus is extensive, with clinical use primarily in the prevention of organ transplant rejection and as an anticancer agent in renal cell carcinoma and neuroendocrine tumors. Its efficacy and safety have been evaluated in multiple clinical trials, and its immunosuppressive effects have been well documented in chronic transplant populations (Sandhu et al., 2018). Although everolimus has not been extensively used in dry AMD per se, its close relative rapamycin has been studied in preclinical models of retinal degeneration; for instance, rapamycin and its analogs have demonstrated benefits in preventing AMD‐like retinopathy in animal models, particularly through enhancing autophagic flux and reducing oxidative stress in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells (Kolosova et al., 2012). Furthermore, early‐phase clinical trials with related mTOR inhibitors in ocular conditions—such as the phase 2 study evaluating everolimus for neovascular AMD—provide supportive background for the potential repurposing of everolimus for dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2009; McGimpsey & Chakravarthy, 2010). This history creates a logical bridge indicating that the biochemical and cellular actions of rapamycin analogs, including everolimus, might extend their therapeutic benefits to dry AMD, despite limited direct clinical use in this indication so far (Chang et al., 2022).

Mechanism of Action:
Everolimus exerts its effects by binding to the immunophilin FK506‐binding protein 12 (FKBP12), forming a complex that allosterically inhibits mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1). This inhibition results in decreased phosphorylation of key downstream effectors such as S6 kinase and 4E‐BP1, which in turn leads to reduced protein synthesis, cellular growth, and potentially excessive cellular proliferation (Walters & Cox, 2018). At the biochemical level, mTORC1 is a critical negative regulator of autophagy; its hyperactivation in aged RPE cells is implicated in the pathogenesis of dry AMD since it prevents the nuclear translocation of transcription factor EB (TFEB), ultimately reducing lysosomal enzyme production and impairing the clearance of photoreceptor outer segments. Everolimus thereby is expected to relieve this inhibition, promoting autophagic flux as evidenced by increased LC3‐II levels, upregulated LAMP2 expression, and enhanced lysosomal biogenesis, which are essential for maintaining RPE cell homeostasis (Kaarniranta et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2022). Additionally, by allowing TFEB to translocate into the nucleus, everolimus is hypothesized to restore the synthesis of lysosomal proteins necessary for effective degradation of lipofuscin‐like granules and other intracellular waste products, thus mitigating the cellular dysfunction observed in dry AMD (Chang et al., 2022).

Expected Effect:
The working hypothesis for using everolimus in dry AMD is that its mTORC1 inhibition will lead to suppression of hyperactive mTOR signaling in aged RPE cells, which otherwise sequesters TFEB in the cytoplasm, thereby impairing lysosomal function and autophagy. In cellular models of AMD, the anticipated biochemical changes include increased levels of autophagy markers such as LC3‐II and enhanced expression of lysosomal proteins like LAMP2. These changes are expected to drive significant improvements in the clearance of photoreceptor outer segments, thereby reducing the accumulation of toxic lipofuscin deposits that are a hallmark of dry AMD pathology (Chang et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022). Preclinical evidence in Abca4−/− mice has demonstrated that systemic treatment with everolimus can reduce lipofuscin‐like granule accumulation by approximately 40% and improve retinal functional responses as determined by electroretinography (McGimpsey & Chakravarthy, 2010). This suggests that, even if administered systemically at doses optimized for ocular exposure, everolimus may exert neuroprotective and restorative effects on RPE cells by enhancing their autophagic capacity and lysosomal degradation pathways, thereby preventing further degeneration of the outer retina (Kaarniranta et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, everolimus represents a promising candidate for repurposing as a treatment for dry AMD, primarily based on its well‐established mechanism of mTORC1 inhibition and its documented ability to enhance autophagy and lysosomal function. One of the major strengths of everolimus is its extensive clinical use history in other indications, which provides a robust safety profile and well‐characterized pharmacokinetic data that can facilitate rapid translation into ophthalmic applications (Sandhu et al., 2018; McGimpsey & Chakravarthy, 2010). Its ability to modulate mTOR signaling, decrease aberrant protein synthesis, and ultimately restore the activity of the autophagy–lysosome pathway addresses a key pathogenic mechanism in dry AMD, where impaired clearance of photoreceptor outer segments in RPE cells leads to the pathological buildup of lipofuscin and subsequent cellular stress (Chang et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022). However, weaknesses include the lack of extensive direct clinical evidence in dry AMD and the potential risks associated with systemic mTOR inhibition, such as immunosuppression, metabolic disturbances, and possible off‐target effects that might affect ocular tissues adversely if not properly dosed (Sandhu et al., 2018; McGimpsey & Chakravarthy, 2010). Moreover, while preclinical animal studies offer promising results, the link between improved autophagic markers in RPE cells and clinically meaningful outcomes in patients with dry AMD remains to be conclusively demonstrated (Kaarniranta et al., 2023; Kolosova et al., 2012). The proposed mechanism, however, is highly specific and offers a targeted approach at a validated control node for autophagy regulation, which could be a significant advantage for a condition that currently lacks effective treatment options (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Chang et al., 2022). In conclusion, while further rigorous preclinical and clinical studies are essential to confirm the efficacy of everolimus for dry AMD, the mechanistic rationale and supporting preclinical data present a compelling case for its potential as a therapeutic candidate in this challenging disease area (Wang et al., 2022).
