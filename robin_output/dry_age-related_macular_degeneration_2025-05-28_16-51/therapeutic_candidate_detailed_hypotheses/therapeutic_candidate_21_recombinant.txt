Proposal for Recombinant human MFG-E8 (Milk fat globule-EGF factor 8; Sino Biological Cat# 10051-H08H)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Recombinant human MFG-E8 (Milk fat globule–epidermal growth factor 8; Sino Biological Cat# 10051-H08H) is a bioengineered version of a naturally secreted glycoprotein originally isolated as a component of the milk fat globule membrane. This glycoprotein belongs to the EGF–like domain protein family and is characterized by its unique structural motifs including N-terminal epidermal growth factor–like repeats and C-terminal discoidin-like domains that bear homology to blood coagulation factors V and VIII; these domains confer its ability to interact with cell surface integrins via an RGD (Arg–Gly–Asp) motif and to bind specific phospholipids found on the surface of apoptotic cells. Recombinant human MFG-E8 is produced using established recombinant DNA technology, typically in mammalian cell expression systems that allow for proper folding, post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, and secretion of a protein that closely mimics the native molecule. As a member of the opsonin class, this therapeutic candidate is designed to “bridge” apoptotic cells to phagocytes through integrin recognition, a mechanism that has been harnessed in various therapeutic explorations; its class of secreted glycoproteins has previously been implicated in promoting apoptotic cell clearance and modulating inflammatory responses in multiple tissues (Meshikhes, 2015).

Therapeutic History:
MFG-E8 has been extensively studied over the years in the context of both inflammatory and degenerative diseases, and its recombinant form has been evaluated in a range of preclinical disease models. In biochemical and cellular studies, the protein has been shown to facilitate phagocytosis by bridging phosphatidylserine residues on apoptotic cells (or debris) to integrin receptors such as αvβ5 present on phagocytic cells, a property that is critical for the clearance of dying cells in tissues including the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) (Klettner et al., 2013). Although recombinant human MFG-E8 has not yet reached widespread clinical use specifically for dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), its therapeutic potential is supported by multiple experimental studies in other inflammatory and degenerative conditions such as sepsis, colitis, ischemia-reperfusion injury, as well as in models of neurodegeneration, where exogenous supplementation restored impaired phagocytosis and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Veterinary applications have also been explored in disease models where tissue injury and impaired clearance contribute to pathology, suggesting that the broad pharmacological profile of recombinant MFG-E8 is adaptable to multiple indications (Meshikhes, 2015). In the context of retinal degeneration, particularly in dry AMD—a disease characterized by RPE dysfunction and accumulation of photoreceptor outer segment (POS) debris—preclinical models have demonstrated that impaired phagocytosis correlates with disease progression, thereby validating MFG-E8’s potential as a repurposed therapeutic candidate; several studies report that boosting MFG-E8 levels can restore POS uptake and promote retinal homeostasis under stress conditions (Pay, 2017).

Mechanism of Action:
The mechanism of action of recombinant human MFG-E8 is well defined at the molecular level. Under normal conditions, the RPE cells perform daily phagocytosis of shed photoreceptor outer segments (POS), a process critical for maintaining retinal homeostasis; this phagocytic function is mediated in part by the αvβ5 integrin receptor. MFG-E8 facilitates this process by acting as a bridging molecule that binds to externalized phosphatidylserine on POS through its C-terminal regions while simultaneously engaging the αvβ5 integrin receptor on RPE cells via its RGD domain located in the N-terminal EGF-like domain. This dual-binding capability initiates integrin clustering and triggers downstream intracellular signaling cascades, including the activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Rac1, which together orchestrate actin cytoskeletal rearrangements necessary for the engulfment and internalization of POS. Experimental models have shown that oxidative stress, a primary contributor to dry AMD pathology, impairs the αvβ5 integrin-mediated phagocytic process; however, supplementation with recombinant MFG-E8 has been observed to restore POS uptake and normalize levels of phosphorylated FAK, indicating that the protein can overcome oxidative inhibition and re-establish efficient phagocytosis (Basyal et al., 2024; Si et al., 2023). In addition, knockdown studies report reductions in phagocytosis by more than 50% when MFG-E8 levels are diminished, which further supports the hypothesis that MFG-E8 is a critical mediator of this process (Klettner et al., 2013). The specificity of MFG-E8 for the early steps of phagocytic recognition—rather than broadly activating phagocytic pathways—distinguishes it from other agents that may modulate RPE function more generally, thereby making it an attractive therapeutic candidate for conditions in which initial binding deficits lead to disease progression (Oshima et al., 2014).

Expected Effect:
Based on its well‐characterized mechanism, the expected effect of recombinant human MFG-E8 supplementation in dry AMD is to restore and enhance the phagocytic activity of RPE cells. In a well‐designed assay employing RPE cells under conditions of oxidative stress (an AMD-like environment), the administration of recombinant human MFG-E8 is anticipated to increase POS binding and uptake, primarily via the specific engagement of the αvβ5 integrin receptor. The anticipated downstream activation of FAK and Rac1 should further confirm that the MFG-E8–integrin interaction is re‐initiating cytoskeletal reorganization necessary for efficient phagocytosis. Given that previous studies have documented a significant reduction in phagocytic efficiency upon MFG-E8 knockdown—with subsequent rescue upon recombinant protein administration—the hypothesis that MFG-E8 supplementation will improve RPE clearance function is well supported (Basyal et al., 2024; Inana et al., 2018). Moreover, this mechanistic action is expected to mitigate accumulations of damaged or non-internalized POS that contribute to the formation of drusen, a pathological hallmark of dry AMD, thereby potentially slowing or reversing disease progression. Since RPE cells are known to express the αvβ5 integrin receptor robustly and depend on MFG-E8 for efficient phagocytosis, restoring its levels is likely to yield beneficial effects in maintaining retinal homeostasis (Si et al., 2023).

Overall Evaluation:
After an extensive review of the biomedical, clinical, and biochemical literature, recombinant human MFG-E8 emerges as a promising candidate for repurposing towards the treatment of dry AMD. The principal strengths of this therapeutic candidate are centered on its specific mechanism of action, which targets the early phase of phagocytic recognition—an area that is notably compromised in dry AMD. By binding photoreceptor outer segments via phosphatidylserine and engaging the αvβ5 integrin on RPE cells, MFG-E8 not only facilitates the clearance of cellular debris but also effectively triggers the intracellular signaling responses (via FAK and Rac1 activation) essential for actin cytoskeletal rearrangement and successful phagocytosis (Basyal et al., 2024; Si et al., 2023). This specificity distinguishes it from more generalized approaches that aim merely to enhance overall phagocytic capacity or reduce oxidative stress without correcting the underlying binding deficit.

A further strength is the robust preclinical evidence supporting the role of MFG-E8 in maintaining retinal homeostasis under conditions of oxidative stress, a major pathogenic factor in dry AMD. Experimental models demonstrate that oxidative damage results in impaired MFG-E8 function and reduced phagocytosis, both of which can be rescued by exogenous administration of recombinant protein. Such data are compelling because they suggest that MFG-E8 therapy could correct the initial cellular defects that trigger a cascade of retinal deterioration. Moreover, recombinant human MFG-E8 has been well characterized in several other disease models ranging from autoimmune conditions and sepsis to ischemia-reperfusion injuries, indicating a favorable bioactivity profile and a capacity to modulate inflammation while restoring phagocytic function (Klettner et al., 2013; Meshikhes, 2015).

However, there are notable challenges and weaknesses to consider. One major limitation is that recombinant human MFG-E8 has not yet undergone rigorous clinical evaluation specifically for dry AMD. The majority of the supportive data are derived from in vitro assays and animal models, which, while promising, may not fully recapitulate the complexity of human retinal pathology. In addition, the direct involvement of MFG-E8 in comprehensive clinical settings remains to be validated in early-phase clinical trials. Safety and optimal dosing in the context of the human eye, particularly in the presence of chronic oxidative stress and established retinal degeneration, need to be thoroughly investigated. Moreover, the multifaceted roles of MFG-E8 in various tissues pose a theoretical risk of off-target effects, especially if systemically delivered; however, the therapeutic design may favor localized ocular application to mitigate such risks (Pay, 2017).

Another potential challenge is the possibility that the efficacy of recombinant human MFG-E8 could be limited by concomitant dysfunctions in other RPE signaling pathways, such as the MerTK-mediated phagocytic machinery. Dry AMD is a multifactorial disease, and while MFG-E8 targets a critical early step in POS clearance, other downstream defects may persist and contribute to ongoing RPE degeneration. Therefore, MFG-E8 supplementation might be most effective when used in combination with other therapies that address additional aspects of the disease pathology, such as oxidative damage or impaired autophagy (Basyal et al., 2024).

In summary, recombinant human MFG-E8 is a highly attractive candidate from both a mechanistic and translational perspective for the treatment of dry AMD. It leverages a precise biochemical mechanism—engagement of the αvβ5 integrin to facilitate phagocytosis of POS—which is crucial in maintaining retinal health and is particularly compromised in AMD. The preclinical data establishing its role in restoring impaired phagocytosis, even under oxidative stress, provide a solid foundation for its further development. Its well-defined mode of action, coupled with its established use in various inflammatory disease models, underscores its potential to fill an unmet medical need in dry AMD, where current therapies remain largely ineffective. Nonetheless, the move into clinical evaluation will require careful assessment of dosing, safety, and synergistic potential with other therapeutic modalities to address the multifactorial nature of RPE dysfunction in AMD (Klettner et al., 2013; Meshikhes, 2015; Motegi et al., 2011; Oshima et al., 2014; Si et al., 2023; Basyal et al., 2024).
