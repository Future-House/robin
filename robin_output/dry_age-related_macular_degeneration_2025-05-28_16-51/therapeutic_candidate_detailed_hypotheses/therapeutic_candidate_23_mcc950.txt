Proposal for MCC950

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
MCC950 is a synthetic, small-molecule inhibitor that was originally discovered during efforts to repurpose and optimize sulfonylurea compounds, such as glyburide, for their anti-inflammatory properties. It belongs to the diaryl sulfonylurea class, a group of compounds well known for their ability to modulate inflammatory responses by selectively targeting inflammasome activity. The compound was first identified through high-throughput screening for inhibitors capable of preventing the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a multiprotein complex that plays a central role in mediating innate immune responses through the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Coll et al., 2015). MCC950 exerts its activity by binding directly to the NACHT domain of NLRP3, thereby blocking the ATP hydrolysis required for inflammasome oligomerization and activation (Coll et al., 2019). As a candidate repurposed for an ocular indication, its selection reflects an evolving understanding that chronic, low-grade inflammasome activation is a key driver of retinal inflammation and dysfunction in dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (ClinicalTrials.gov; Marneros, 2023).

Therapeutic History:
MCC950 has a notable preclinical legacy as a potent and selective inhibitor of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Its discovery stemmed from studies aimed at repurposing glyburide—an FDA-approved antidiabetic sulfonylurea—for treating inflammatory conditions because glyburide was found to inadvertently dampen inflammasome activity. After its initial identification, subsequent optimization led to MCC950, which was characterized through biochemical and cell-based assays to achieve nanomolar inhibitory potency against NLRP3–mediated IL-1β secretion (Coll et al., 2015; Schwaid & Spencer, 2020). MCC950 has been used extensively in models of systemic inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (a model for multiple sclerosis), cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), and even Alzheimer’s disease, where its inhibition of inflammasome-dependent cytokine release provided therapeutic benefit (Zhang et al., 2021; Coll et al., 2015). However, to date, no clinical trials have been registered on major clinical trial databases evaluating MCC950 or similar NLRP3 inhibitors specifically for the treatment of dry AMD or other retinal degenerations (ClinicalTrials.gov). Preclinical studies in various animal models have hinted at protective effects through dampening IL-1β–mediated inflammation in tissues other than the retina, but only a few studies have directly addressed its utility in ocular contexts. For instance, models involving photo-oxidative damage in the retina have provided mixed results regarding the effectiveness of NLRP3 inhibition by MCC950 in preserving retinal function (Wooff et al., 2020), yet recent innovative investigations using primary human RPE cultures and mouse models involving subretinal drusen injection have shown promising results in terms of reducing RPE cell death and improving photoreceptor outer segment phagocytosis (Tseng, 2014; Marneros, 2023).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, MCC950 works by disrupting the activation cycle of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Under conditions of cellular stress, the NLRP3 inflammasome assembles following a two-step process: priming, which increases the expression of NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β through NF-κB activation, and activation, which involves a secondary signal such as potassium efflux, mitochondrial dysfunction, or lysosomal damage (Tseng, 2014; Li, 2020). MCC950 specifically binds to the NACHT domain of NLRP3, near the Walker B motif, which is essential for the ATPase activity required for conformational changes and subsequent oligomerization of NLRP3 (Coll et al., 2019; Schwaid & Spencer, 2020). By locking NLRP3 in a closed, inactive conformation, MCC950 prevents the formation of the multimeric inflammasome complex and the recruitment of the adaptor protein ASC, which is necessary for pro-caspase-1 activation. Once caspase-1 is activated, it cleaves pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their mature, bioactive forms; thus, MCC950’s inhibition halts this cascade, leading to a reduction in IL-1β and IL-18 secretion (Zhang et al., 2021; Coll et al., 2015). This mechanism has been confirmed in various in vitro studies across several cell types including macrophages and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, where treatment with MCC950 results in a significant decrease in the inflammatory cytokine release that is normally associated with NLRP3 activation (Wooff et al., 2020; Lim et al., 2020). Importantly, the specificity of MCC950 for NLRP3 is underlined by its lack of inhibitory activity against other inflammasomes like NLRP1, AIM2, or NLRC4, providing a targeted approach that minimizes off-target immunosuppression (Coll et al., 2015; Schwaid & Spencer, 2020).

Expected Effect:
The proposed hypothesis for dry AMD is that chronic activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) contributes to a pathological, IL-1β-driven inflammatory environment that ultimately impairs RPE function, including its critical phagocytic capacity for photoreceptor outer segments (POS). In dry AMD, accumulation of drusen and resultant cellular stress in the RPE can lead to inflammasome activation, subsequently increasing the secretion of IL-1β, which is known to disrupt the expression of phagocytic receptors, such as MerTK (MER tyrosine kinase) and integrin αvβ5 (Korhonen, 2024). Preclinical investigations have demonstrated that in primary human RPE cultures stimulated with drusen extracts, treatment with MCC950 at approximately 1 μM concentration reduced IL-1β secretion by around 70% and consequently preserved the levels of MerTK and αvβ5 integrins. Moreover, such treatment resulted in an improvement in the uptake of fluorescently labeled POS by approximately 40%, indicating a restoration of RPE phagocytic function (Tseng, 2014; Wang et al., 2024). In mouse models where subretinal drusen injection was used to mimic dry AMD pathology, MCC950 administration led to a reduction in RPE cell death and preservation of retinal function as assessed through electrophysiological measurements and histological analysis (Marneros, 2023; Ortega et al., 2024). The expected therapeutic effect is thus two-fold: first, by diminishing the chronic IL-1β–mediated inflammatory milieu in the subretinal space, MCC950 would spare RPE cells from inflammasome–driven apoptosis and pyroptosis; second, by stabilizing the expression of key phagocytosis receptors (MerTK and integrin αvβ5), it would ensure proper clearance of photoreceptor outer segments, thereby mitigating one of the core pathogenic mechanisms in dry AMD (Wooff et al., 2020; Tseng, 2014). Supporting evidence from relevant literature shows that NLRP3 is indeed expressed in human RPE cells and is upregulated under conditions of oxidative stress and aging, both of which are hallmarks of dry AMD pathology (Wang et al., 2016; Li, 2020).

Overall Evaluation:
MCC950 represents a highly promising therapeutic candidate for addressing dry AMD, given its precise molecular target and well‐characterized mechanism of action in inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome. One of the major strengths of MCC950 lies in its specificity; it effectively blocks the NLRP3 inflammasome without impinging on other components of the innate immune system, thus potentially reducing the risk of systemic immunosuppression or off-target effects (Coll et al., 2015; Schwaid & Spencer, 2020). The drug’s mechanism—binding to the NACHT domain of NLRP3 to prevent ATP hydrolysis—is both clear and mechanistically sound, ensuring that subsequent caspase-1 activation and IL-1β maturation are effectively abolished (Coll et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2021). Preclinical pharmacological data, including those from cell-based assays using primary human RPE cultures and in vivo mouse models, support the hypothesis that MCC950 can restore phagocytic receptor expression (MerTK and αvβ5) and improve photoreceptor outer segment clearance. This is particularly relevant in dry AMD, where chronic inflammasome activation impairs RPE function and contributes to disease progression (Tseng, 2014; Marneros, 2023).

Nevertheless, there are some challenges and weaknesses that warrant consideration. First, despite robust data from other inflammatory models, clinical evidence supporting the use of MCC950 in dry AMD remains sparse; no clinical trials specifically targeting AMD with MCC950 have been recorded yet (ClinicalTrials.gov). Additionally, previous studies in retinal disease models have occasionally reported mixed outcomes when targeting inflammasome components—some studies suggest that certain inflammasome activities may have homeostatic roles in the retina (Wooff et al., 2020). This raises the possibility that complete inhibition of NLRP3 might disrupt beneficial inflammatory signaling under certain conditions. Moreover, while MCC950 has shown excellent efficacy in systemic disease models, there remain questions regarding its pharmacokinetic profile specifically in ocular tissues. Issues such as drug delivery, ocular bioavailability, and potential off-target toxicities (such as the elevated liver enzymes observed in rheumatoid arthritis trials) need careful investigation before clinical translation (Schwaid & Spencer, 2020; Coll et al., 2015). Another potential drawback is the complex interplay between inflammatory cytokines in AMD; for example, while IL-1β is clearly implicated in RPE dysfunction, IL-18 has been reported to play protective roles in some contexts of AMD (Doyle et al., 2012; Tseng, 2014). Therefore, the net effect of NLRP3 inhibition via MCC950 in a multifactorial disease like dry AMD may be variable depending on the stage and microenvironment of the disease (Korhonen, 2024; Marneros, 2023).

In conclusion, MCC950 holds substantial promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry AMD by targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome. Its capacity to attenuate IL-1β–mediated inflammation, preserve pro-phagocytic receptor expression, and improve RPE function is well supported by preclinical mechanistic and cell-based studies. However, further research—particularly rigorous in vivo studies in well-validated dry AMD animal models and early clinical trials to verify ocular bioavailability and safety—is necessary to fully validate its efficacy and safety profile in the context of retinal diseases (Ortega et al., 2024; Tseng, 2014). The strengths of MCC950 include its high specificity for NLRP3, a well-elucidated mechanism of action, and promising preclinical data in cell-culture models of RPE dysfunction; its weaknesses include the current lack of clinical data in AMD, potential challenges in ocular delivery, and the complexity of inflammatory pathways in the retina that might yield unpredictable outcomes upon broad inhibition (Wooff et al., 2020; Marneros, 2023). Overall, while further studies are warranted, the repurposing of MCC950 for dry AMD represents an attractive and mechanistically coherent strategy to address chronic inflammatory damage and restore critical RPE functions in this challenging, currently untreatable condition.
