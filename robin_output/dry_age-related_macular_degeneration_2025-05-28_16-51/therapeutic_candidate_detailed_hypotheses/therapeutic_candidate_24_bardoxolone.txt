Proposal for Bardoxolone methyl (CDDO-Me; Reata Pharmaceuticals)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Bardoxolone methyl (also known as CDDO‐Me or RTA‐402) is a synthetic oleanane triterpenoid derived from the naturally occurring oleanolic acid. It was designed by medicinal chemists to improve upon the pharmacokinetic properties and biological potency of its natural precursor. As a member of the synthetic triterpenoid class, Bardoxolone methyl was intentionally optimized to possess superior electrophilic properties that enable it to specifically interact with critical cysteine residues on regulatory proteins such as KEAP1. This class of compounds is well known for its robust ability to activate the Nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (NRF2) pathway and has been studied extensively for its antioxidative, anti‐inflammatory, and cytoprotective activities. Historically, compounds in this class have been investigated in diverse chronic diseases ranging from cancer to chronic kidney disease because of their capacity to modulate redox homeostasis and inflammatory responses (Cheng et al., 2021; Handa, 2012).

Therapeutic History:
Bardoxolone methyl has an extensive history in biochemical and clinical studies. It has been evaluated in multiple clinical trials, particularly for chronic kidney disease and diabetic nephropathy, and in oncology settings due to its ability to modulate oxidative stress and inflammatory signaling. Phase I and II clinical trials have demonstrated that Bardoxolone methyl is orally bioavailable, can achieve therapeutically relevant plasma concentrations, and effectively activates NRF2 target genes such as HO-1 and NQO1 in various tissues (Zhang, 2013; To et al., 2015). Although its direct investigation in ocular diseases or dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) has been less prominent, related preclinical studies have evaluated its effects in retinal cells. For instance, in ARPE-19 cells—an established human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell line—Bardoxolone methyl has been shown to robustly induce Nrf2-dependent genes under oxidative stress conditions, reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory cytokine secretion (Cheng et al., 2021; Handa, 2012). Furthermore, clinical trial database searches indicate significant research interest in Bardoxolone methyl in the context of AMD and geographic atrophy (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), suggesting that while dedicated retinal trials might be limited, there is translational potential given its systemic pharmacological profile.

Mechanism of Action:
Bardoxolone methyl exerts its principal mechanism of action through direct modulation of the KEAP1-NRF2 pathway. Under normal conditions, NRF2, a redox-sensitive transcription factor, is sequestered in the cytoplasm by KEAP1, which directs its ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Bardoxolone methyl contains reactive α,β-unsaturated carbonyl groups that enable it to form reversible Michael adducts with specific cysteine residues (such as Cys151) on KEAP1. This covalent modification disrupts the KEAP1-NRF2 interaction, thereby preventing NRF2’s degradation. The liberated NRF2 then translocates into the nucleus where it dimerizes with small Maf proteins and binds to antioxidant response elements (ARE) in the promoter regions of a wide array of genes. As a result, transcription of critical phase II detoxification and antioxidant genes—including NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic (GCLC) and modulatory subunits (GCLM)—is robustly induced (Mathis & Cui, 2016; Zhou et al., 2014). In addition, Bardoxolone methyl has been reported to modulate other signaling pathways such as NF-κB, thereby exerting anti-inflammatory effects by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine production including IL-1β. This dual mechanism, involving both enhanced antioxidant capacity and suppression of innate inflammatory responses, is critically important in tissues such as the retinal pigment epithelium, where chronic oxidative stress and inflammation underpin pathogenesis (Handa, 2012; Nakagami, 2016).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis for repurposing Bardoxolone methyl in dry age-related macular degeneration is that its activation of NRF2 will restore redox homeostasis in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, preserve lysosomal function, and enhance the process of photoreceptor outer segment (POS) phagocytosis. Specifically, by binding to KEAP1 and releasing NRF2, Bardoxolone methyl is expected to upregulate antioxidant enzymes such as HO-1 and NQO1. These enzymes play crucial roles in detoxifying reactive oxygen species, thereby reducing oxidative damage within RPE cells. Experimental data have demonstrated that in ARPE-19 cells, Bardoxolone methyl robustly increases the expression of NRF2 targets under oxidative stress conditions, leading to a reduction in ROS, decreased accumulation of lipofuscin-like deposits, and diminished secretion of inflammatory mediators like IL-1β (Cheng et al., 2021; To et al., 2015). Given that impaired phagocytosis of POS by RPE cells is a key feature in the pathology of dry AMD, boosting innate cellular defenses via NRF2 activation is anticipated to enhance phagocytic efficiency and maintain retinal health. Moreover, by mitigating complement activation and the downstream NLRP3 inflammasome, Bardoxolone methyl could directly counteract the inflammatory cascade that contributes to RPE dysfunction in dry AMD (Handa, 2012; Cheng et al., 2021). Collectively, these antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and cytoprotective effects are expected to preserve RPE cell function, ultimately slowing or halting the progression of dry AMD.

Overall Evaluation:
Bardoxolone methyl presents a scientifically compelling candidate for repurposing in the treatment of dry age-related macular degeneration based on its well-characterized mechanism of action, preclinical efficacy, and clinical history in other oxidative stress-related diseases. One significant strength of this compound is its direct mechanism of KEAP1 inhibition leading to robust activation of NRF2 and subsequent upregulation of a broad spectrum of antioxidant and phase II detoxification enzymes. This targeted activation provides mechanistic specificity that is superior to general antioxidant supplements, which often suffer from low potency and limited bioavailability (Zhang, 2013; Zhou et al., 2014). Furthermore, the fact that Bardoxolone methyl has advanced into clinical trials for indications such as chronic kidney disease and cancer demonstrates that its pharmacokinetics, oral bioavailability, and safety profile have been sufficiently evaluated to warrant further repurposing efforts (To et al., 2015; Hybertson et al., 2014).

However, there are challenges that must be carefully considered. One notable weakness in repurposing Bardoxolone methyl for dry AMD is the lack of direct clinical evidence in retinal applications. While preclinical data in ARPE-19 cells are promising, the translation of these findings into clinical efficacy in AMD patients must be validated through targeted retinal studies and appropriately designed clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Cheng et al., 2021). Additionally, previous clinical trials in non-ocular settings have identified safety concerns—most notably, cardiovascular adverse events in patients with chronic kidney disease—suggesting that the systemic effects of Bardoxolone methyl and its off-target interactions require further refinement and careful monitoring (Hybertson et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2020). Given that the eye is a sensitive organ, alternative delivery methods (e.g., localized intraocular administration or topical formulations) might be needed to limit systemic exposure and potential side effects while ensuring efficacious retinal concentrations.

Another potential challenge is ensuring that the compound not only activates NRF2 but does so in a manner that effectively restores lysosomal function and enhances POS phagocytosis in RPE cells. Although the hypothesis is strongly supported by the known biology of NRF2 and evidence from ARPE-19 cell studies, comprehensive in vivo studies in animal models of dry AMD are necessary to confirm these multifaceted effects. Moreover, the chronic nature of dry AMD implies that any therapeutic intervention must maintain sustainable NRF2 activation without triggering compensatory mechanisms that might attenuate the benefit or increase reductive stress – a phenomenon that can itself be detrimental (Mathis & Cui, 2016; Nakagami, 2016).

Despite these reservations, the overall strengths of Bardoxolone methyl—its potent NRF2 activation, documented effects on reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, and its existing clinical data in other indications—make it a promising candidate for further investigation in dry AMD. The mechanism by which Bardoxolone methyl acts is particularly attractive because it offers a means to address not only oxidative stress but also the inflammatory cascades associated with complement activation and NLRP3 inflammasome signaling, which are critical in the pathogenesis of dry AMD (Handa, 2012; Cheng et al., 2021).

In summary, Bardoxolone methyl, as a synthetic triterpenoid with direct KEAP1 binding and robust NRF2 activation, offers a strong biochemical rationale for use in dry AMD treatments. The expected effects—namely, enhancement of antioxidant defenses, reduction of ROS and pro-inflammatory cytokines, preservation of lysosomal function, and improvement in RPE cell phagocytic capacity—address several key pathological mechanisms underlying dry AMD. While further preclinical studies specifically focused on retinal tissues and well-designed clinical trials are required to fully establish its efficacy and safety for ocular application, the comprehensive evidence from biochemical, cellular, and systemic studies strongly supports continued investigation of Bardoxolone methyl as a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry AMD (Cheng et al., 2021; Handa, 2012; To et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2014).
