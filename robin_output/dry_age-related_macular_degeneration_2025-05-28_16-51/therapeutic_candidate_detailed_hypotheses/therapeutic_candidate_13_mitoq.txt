Proposal for MitoQ (mitoquinone)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
MitoQ (mitoquinone) is a synthetic mitochondria‐targeted antioxidant that was developed by chemically conjugating a ubiquinone (coenzyme Q) antioxidant moiety to a lipophilic triphenylphosphonium (TPP⁺) cation via an aliphatic linker. This design exploits the large negative membrane potential across the inner mitochondrial membrane to drive selective accumulation of the compound into mitochondria, where its ubiquinone group can undergo reduction to its active antioxidant form — mitoquinol — and function in situ to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS). MitoQ belongs to the class of mitochondria‐targeted antioxidants, a family of compounds that includes other molecules such as SkQ1, MitoPBN and MitoVitE. These compounds have been synthesized and evaluated extensively to overcome the limitations of conventional antioxidants, whose lack of cellular and subcellular specificity often limits their efficacy in diseases where oxidative stress is compartmentalized, such as in mitochondrial dysfunction. Research has demonstrated that such TPP⁺-conjugated antioxidants can concentrate several hundred-fold within mitochondria, ensuring high local antioxidant capacity and better mitigation of oxidative insults. The synthetic strategy and molecular design of MitoQ capitalizes on the natural properties of ubiquinone in the electron transport chain, but through chemical modification it has been endowed with enhanced mitochondrial uptake and improved pharmacokinetic profiles — factors that support its potential repurposing for diseases like dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) where mitochondrial oxidative stress in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells is considered a key pathological driver (Murphy & Hartley, 2018; Apostolova & Victor, 2015).

Therapeutic History:
MitoQ has been investigated in a variety of biochemical and preclinical contexts due to its ability to attenuate mitochondrial oxidative damage. Its development initially targeted conditions characterized by excessive mitochondrial ROS such as neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases), cardiovascular dysfunction, and metabolic syndromes. Preclinical studies have reported safety and efficacy in models of ischemia-reperfusion injury, where MitoQ reduced tissue damage through its ROS-scavenging properties and improved mitochondrial function. Additionally, MitoQ has been evaluated in clinical trials for conditions such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and vascular dysfunction, where its ability to improve endothelial function and reduce oxidative biomarkers has been established (Apostolova & Victor, 2015; Bubb et al., 2020). Although there are no registered clinical trials specifically targeting dry AMD or retinal degeneration (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), preclinical studies and biochemical evidence demonstrate that mitochondrial oxidative stress plays a central role in retinal diseases. For instance, research in animal models of AMD has shown that accumulation of ROS in RPE cells can lead to lysosomal dysfunction, compromise autophagy, and contribute to the build-up of undigested photoreceptor outer segments (POS) (Han, 2018; Jarrett & Boulton, 2012). Given the therapeutic history and broad evaluation of MitoQ in oxidative stress–related pathologies, repurposing it for dry AMD is scientifically plausible, especially as its mechanism has been extensively validated in other conditions characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction (Apostolova & Victor, 2015; Murphy & Hartley, 2018).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, MitoQ functions primarily as a redox-active antioxidant localized to mitochondria. The TPP⁺ moiety facilitates the compound’s passage through lipid bilayers and its accumulation into the mitochondrial matrix driven by the negative membrane potential of the inner mitochondrial membrane (Fields et al., 2023). Once inside the mitochondria, MitoQ is reduced by components of the electron transport chain—predominantly by complex II, or succinate dehydrogenase—to its active form, mitoquinol. This reduced form is capable of neutralizing reactive oxygen species such as superoxide anion (O₂•⁻), peroxyl radicals, and peroxynitrite by donating an electron, thereby interrupting lipid peroxidation chain reactions that would otherwise damage mitochondrial membranes, proteins, and mitochondrial DNA (Apostolova & Victor, 2015; Murphy & Hartley, 2018). When the antioxidant activity is exerted, mitoquinol is re-oxidized back to mitoquinone and can be continuously recycled within the mitochondria. This rechargeable cycle permits prolonged reduction in mitochondrial oxidative stress without significantly interfering with normal electron transport, since MitoQ is a poor substrate for complexes I and III and does not act as a primary electron carrier (Hirzel, 2013; Lukashev et al., 2014). In preclinical ARPE-19 cell models exposed to oxidative stress, MitoQ has been shown to reduce mitochondrial ROS levels by about 60% at a concentration of 500 nM. This reduction in ROS is critical not only for protecting mitochondrial integrity but also for preventing the oxidative inhibition of lysosomal enzymes that can lead to impaired autophagy and a subsequent accumulation of undigested photoreceptor outer segments—a pathological cascade implicated in dry AMD (Jarrett & Boulton, 2012; Kim et al., 2021). In effect, by preserving the oxidative balance within RPE mitochondria, MitoQ may indirectly normalize lysosomal pH and restore effective autophagic clearance, which is essential in maintaining retinal homeostasis (Apostolova & Victor, 2015; Fields et al., 2023).

Expected Effect:
The hypothesis underpinning the repurposing of MitoQ for dry AMD is that by selectively accumulating in RPE mitochondria and reducing mitochondrial-derived ROS, MitoQ will alleviate the oxidative stress that disrupts lysosomal enzyme function. In dry AMD, the RPE is responsible for phagocytosing and degrading shed POS, a process that is compromised by oxidative damage leading to the accumulation of lipofuscin and other toxic by-products. By normalizing mitochondrial redox state, MitoQ is expected to prevent the oxidative inhibition of lysosomal hydrolases, thereby restoring lysosomal pH and improving autophagic flux. This, in turn, should enhance the clearance of accumulated POS and reduce the cellular stress that leads to progressive RPE dysfunction and subsequent photoreceptor degeneration (Han, 2018; Nita & Grzybowski, 2023). Experimental data in ARPE-19 cells have shown that treatment with 500 nM MitoQ decreases mitochondrial ROS by approximately 60%, increases the intensity of the LysoTracker Red signal—which indicates normalized lysosomal pH—and improves FITC-labeled POS uptake by about 33%, which suggests enhanced phagocytic and autophagic activity. These findings imply that MitoQ, through its mitochondrial antioxidant action, could potentially reverse one of the critical pathological features observed in dry AMD: impaired autophagy and lysosomal degradation in the RPE (Ji et al., 2021; Kim et al., 2021). Furthermore, preclinical studies in rabbits have confirmed that MitoQ can accumulate in retinal tissues and demonstrate a favorable safety profile, lending further support to its development as an ocular therapeutic (Macdonald et al., 2018; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Overall Evaluation:
Based on the comprehensive literature review detailed above, MitoQ emerges as a promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of dry age-related macular degeneration. One of the key strengths of MitoQ lies in its well-defined mechanism of action. As a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant, it addresses the critical role of mitochondrial oxidative stress in RPE dysfunction, a fundamental pathological factor in dry AMD (Apostolova & Victor, 2015; Jarrett & Boulton, 2012). The molecular design that couples ubiquinone with a TPP⁺ cation ensures that MitoQ selectively accumulates in mitochondria, effectively scavenging ROS in situ, which is a significant advantage over conventional, non-targeted antioxidants that lack such specificity (Fields et al., 2023; Zielonka et al., 2017).

From a therapeutic history standpoint, although there are no direct clinical trials for dry AMD that have utilized MitoQ (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), MitoQ’s efficacy in other diseases characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress—such as cardiovascular diseases, liver dysfunction, and neurodegenerative disorders—provides a strong rationale for its further evaluation in retinal diseases (Apostolova & Victor, 2015; Bubb et al., 2020). Preclinical evidence in cultured ARPE-19 cells, where MitoQ improved markers of mitochondrial and lysosomal function, reinforces the expectations that improved mitochondrial redox balance can restore autophagic processes essential for POS clearance in the RPE (Ji et al., 2021; Kim et al., 2021).

Mechanistically, MitoQ has been shown to participate in a rechargeable antioxidant cycle within mitochondria and to significantly reduce oxidative stress without interfering with normal electron transport, thereby preserving mitochondrial integrity and function. This characteristic is particularly relevant given that unchecked ROS production in RPE cells not only leads to the impairment of lysosomal enzymes but also disrupts autophagy, thereby contributing to the progression of dry AMD (Jarrett & Boulton, 2012; Murphy & Hartley, 2018). The expected effect of MitoQ—increased clearance of damaged POS via normalized lysosomal function—aligns well with the concept that restoring cellular homeostasis in the RPE can mitigate the progression of AMD. The reported improvements in lysosomal pH (as evidenced by increased LysoTracker Red signals) and enhanced phagocytosis in ARPE-19 cells are particularly encouraging, highlighting a functional rescue of a key defect in dry AMD (Ji et al., 2021; Kim et al., 2021).

Nonetheless, there are certain weaknesses to consider. Although the preclinical data in ARPE-19 cells and animal models are promising, the translation of these findings to human patients remains uncertain. There are inherent differences between cultured cell models and the complex in vivo environment of the human retina. Moreover, while MitoQ has been shown to be safe and to accumulate in retinal tissues in animal studies, the ocular bioavailability in humans and the efficiency of topical or systemic delivery to the RPE in AMD patients require further investigation (Macdonald et al., 2018; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additionally, given that clinical trials in other conditions, such as Parkinson’s disease, have sometimes failed to demonstrate significant benefits despite promising preclinical efficacy, the design of future AMD-specific clinical trials should incorporate appropriate biomarkers for mitochondrial function, lysosomal activity, and autophagic flux in the RPE (Apostolova & Victor, 2015; Ji et al., 2021).

Overall, MitoQ’s strengths include its well-established mechanism as a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant, its demonstrated ability to reduce mitochondrial ROS and restore lysosomal and autophagic function in preclinical models, and its favorable safety profile in other disease contexts. Its weaknesses pertain primarily to the current lack of direct clinical evidence in dry AMD, the challenge of translating cellular and animal data to the human ocular setting, and the need for optimized drug delivery systems to maximize retinal bioavailability. In sum, based on the current literature, MitoQ represents a well-rationalized and promising therapeutic candidate for further investigation as a treatment for dry AMD. It warrants additional preclinical studies in retinal-specific models and carefully designed clinical trials that focus on mitochondrial function and autophagy in the RPE (Jarrett & Boulton, 2012; Ji et al., 2021; Murphy & Hartley, 2018).
