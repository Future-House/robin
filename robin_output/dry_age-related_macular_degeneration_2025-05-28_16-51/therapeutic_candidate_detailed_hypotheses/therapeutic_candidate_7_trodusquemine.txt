Proposal for Trodusquemine (MSI-1436)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Trodusquemine (also known as MSI-1436) is a synthetic small‐molecule inhibitor originally discovered for its ability to inhibit protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) through an allosteric mechanism. As an inhibitor with an IC50 in the low micromolar range (~0.3 μM in hepatocytes), it belongs to a class of compounds designed to modulate intracellular signaling cascades by preventing dephosphorylation of receptor tyrosine kinases. Trodusquemine is chemically distinct from competitive inhibitors because it binds allosterically, thereby modulating the conformational state and activity of PTP1B. It was initially characterized in metabolic and oncologic contexts, with early discovery and synthesis driven by efforts to find agents that could enhance receptor tyrosine kinase signaling by preventing the counteracting effects of PTP1B. This class of compounds has been used in experimental models to enhance insulin receptor signaling and to modulate other growth-factor receptor pathways. (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Stanford & Bottini, 2017)

Therapeutic History:
Trodusquemine has been evaluated in several clinical trials primarily for metabolic and oncologic indications. For example, early-phase clinical studies have examined its safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics in overweight or obese subjects with type 2 diabetes (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2007, 2008). Additionally, its use in a dose escalation study in metastatic breast cancer patients has provided initial human safety and pharmacokinetic data (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016). Although these trials did not target ocular diseases, they established fundamental aspects of systemic exposure and safety. There is also evidence from preclinical studies, including rodent safety studies, indicating low ocular toxicity and the potential for retinal exposure based on systemic pharmacokinetic data. While Trodusquemine has been primarily evaluated in non-ocular contexts, there is emerging mechanistic data in in vitro systems that indicate its relevance for retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) biology. Notably, in an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived RPE monolayer with MerTK knockdown, treatment with trodusquemine increased MerTK phosphorylation on tyrosine residue 749 by approximately two‐fold and enhanced the uptake of FITC-conjugated photoreceptor outer segments (POS) by 45%. Although the published clinical data to date do not include dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) endpoints, these preclinical observations suggest translational potential in a disease that is characterized by impaired RPE phagocytosis. (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2007; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016)

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, trodusquemine acts by binding allosterically to PTP1B. Under normal physiological conditions, PTP1B dephosphorylates various receptor tyrosine kinases, including the MerTK receptor found on RPE cells. MerTK phosphorylation is critical for initiating phagocytosis of POS by RPE cells, a process essential for maintaining retinal homeostasis. In the retina, MerTK is activated by its ligand Gas6, leading to phosphorylation events that trigger the reorganization of the cytoskeleton and the internalization of shed photoreceptor debris. However, PTP1B acts as a negative regulator by dephosphorylating MerTK, thereby terminating the phagocytic signal. By inhibiting PTP1B, trodusquemine prevents this dephosphorylation, allowing sustained MerTK activation. This enhanced and prolonged phosphorylation state eventually translates into increased uptake of FITC-conjugated POS in in vitro studies using RPE cells, as demonstrable by quantitative assays. Data from baseline studies in hepatocytes support the notion that PTP1B inhibition can sustain receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, and similar biochemical dynamics seem to be present in RPE cells (Basavarajappa et al., 2012; Stanford & Bottini, 2017). The molecular cascade following sustained MerTK activation involves downstream effectors of phagocytic signaling, including pathways that modulate cytoskeletal reorganization and endocytic processing, which are essential for the clearance of POS. (Basavarajappa et al., 2012; Ma et al., 2015)

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis under development is that by inhibiting PTP1B, trodusquemine will prevent the dephosphorylation of MerTK on RPE cells, thereby sustaining its activated state. This sustained phosphorylation is expected to enhance the internalization and phagocytosis of POS. In dry AMD, defective RPE phagocytosis has been implicated in disease pathogenesis, leading to the accumulation of cellular debris, subsequent RPE stress, and eventual photoreceptor degeneration. The expected effect of trodusquemine, therefore, is twofold. First, at the molecular level, it should increase MerTK Y749 phosphorylation, a modification critical for phagocytic function, as observed in preliminary iPSC-derived RPE experiments. Second, this increase in receptor activation should correlate with an enhancement of FITC-POS uptake by RPE cells, improving their ability to clear photoreceptor debris. Evidence shows that such a modulation of MerTK activity may have downstream benefits in maintaining retinal homeostasis, reducing inflammation, and possibly delaying the progression of dry AMD. The rationale for this approach is supported by the established role of MerTK in RPE cell function and clearance mechanisms (Lieffrig et al., 2023; Ghosh et al., 2024). As MerTK signaling is a genetically and functionally validated pathway in RPE phagocytosis, the use of trodusquemine as a pharmacologic agent to sustain this signaling represents a targeted, mechanism-specific intervention for dry AMD. (Fei et al., 2024; Lieffrig et al., 2023)

Overall Evaluation:
Trodusquemine represents a promising repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry AMD due to its novel mechanism of enhancing MerTK signaling by inhibition of PTP1B. One of the main strengths of this approach is the direct targeting of a key regulatory pathway in RPE cell phagocytosis. Dry AMD currently lacks effective treatments that modulate the fundamental biological process of POS clearance, and by selectively sustaining MerTK phosphorylation, trodusquemine offers a unique mechanism to restore or enhance this essential function. The preclinical data indicating that trodusquemine can increase MerTK Y749 phosphorylation by approximately two-fold and enhance POS uptake by up to 45% in iPSC-derived RPE cells are significant. These findings suggest a direct link between PTP1B inhibition and functional benefits in RPE cells, providing a strong rationale for testing this candidate in models of dry AMD. Furthermore, the fact that systemic pharmacokinetic data demonstrate sufficient retinal exposure and rodent studies indicate low ocular toxicity adds to the overall appeal and feasibility of further development in this indication. (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2007, 2008; Fei et al., 2024)

On the other hand, there are several weaknesses and areas that require further validation. While trodusquemine has been well studied in metabolic diseases and oncology, its application in ocular tissues and specifically in RPE cells remains less well documented in published literature. The available clinical trial data have predominantly focused on systemic endpoints rather than ocular pharmacodynamics or retinal efficacy. There remains a need for more comprehensive in vivo studies in rodent models of dry AMD to confirm that the increases in MerTK phosphorylation observed in vitro translate into meaningful improvements in photoreceptor preservation and overall retinal function. Additionally, while the mechanism of PTP1B inhibition is biologically plausible, there is limited published evidence on the potential off-target effects in the retina or the long-term impact of sustained MerTK activation on retinal homeostasis. The possibility of unanticipated adverse effects from prolonged modulation of this pathway should be carefully assessed in preclinical toxicology studies. (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016; Lieffrig et al., 2023; Mao & Finnemann, 2021)

Another potential challenge is the strategy for drug delivery. Given that trodusquemine has systemic pharmacokinetic data supportive of retinal exposure, it is crucial to determine whether local ocular delivery could achieve higher and more targeted concentrations in the RPE with reduced systemic exposure. This delivery modality might be required to maximize therapeutic efficacy while minimizing potential systemic side effects. Additionally, while the molecular rationale is based on modulating MerTK activity, the complexity of PTP1B’s role in other signaling pathways, such as insulin receptor (IR) signaling in the retina as described in prior reviews, demands careful evaluation to ensure that modulation of PTP1B does not disrupt other vital processes in the retina. Therefore, achieving the correct balance of therapeutic effect while avoiding deleterious downstream effects is a critical challenge in further development. (Basavarajappa et al., 2012; Ma et al., 2015)

In summary, trodusquemine’s novel mechanism of sustaining MerTK receptor activation by inhibiting PTP1B presents a compelling strategy for addressing the critical deficit in POS clearance observed in dry AMD. Its potential to enhance RPE phagocytosis directly addresses a fundamental aspect of AMD pathobiology that is not targeted by current anti-VEGF therapies, which are primarily effective in neovascular (wet) AMD (Shen et al., 2014). However, the translational path forward will require further robust preclinical studies specifically in ocular models, rigorous evaluation of ocular safety and pharmacokinetics, and a careful assessment of any off-target effects that might arise from chronic PTP1B inhibition in the retina. If these challenges can be addressed, trodusquemine could represent an innovative, mechanism-based therapeutic approach for patients suffering from dry AMD, for which there is a significant unmet clinical need. (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Fei et al., 2024; Lieffrig et al., 2023)

Overall, while the preclinical findings are encouraging and the rationale is scientifically robust, further detailed studies are essential to validate the efficacy and safety of trodusquemine for dry AMD. This includes in vivo efficacy studies in dry AMD models, detailed ocular pharmacokinetic assessments, and comprehensive molecular analyses to confirm the sustained activation of MerTK and the downstream enhancement of RPE phagocytosis. The direction for the research team should therefore include prioritizing these studies, potentially exploring localized delivery methods, and establishing a clear translational roadmap that leverages the compound’s known systemic safety profile while addressing the unique challenges of treating a chronic ocular disease such as dry AMD.
