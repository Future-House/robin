Proposal for Fenofibrate

Below is our detailed evaluation of fenofibrate as a promising candidate for dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD).

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Fenofibrate is a synthetic compound belonging to the fibrate class of lipid‐lowering agents that act primarily as agonists of the peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor alpha (PPARα). Originally developed to treat dyslipidemia by reducing plasma triglycerides and increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, fenofibrate is a well-characterized small molecule that was discovered through traditional medicinal chemistry approaches aimed at improving lipid profiles in patients with hypertriglyceridemia. Its synthesis relies on modifying the basic fibric acid structure to yield an agent with enhanced potency and bioavailability, and fenofibrate is commercially available from catalogs such as Sigma-Aldrich (Sigma-Aldrich catalog #F6020). As a member of the fibrate class, fenofibrate has been extensively used in clinical practice to manage systemic lipid disorders and has been studied for its benefits on cardiovascular risk factors. More recently, a paradigm shift in drug repurposing has led investigators to examine its ocular bioactivity, particularly because of its known PPARα agonist activity that modulates inflammatory signaling and lipid metabolism. The class of compounds represented by fenofibrate has been used not only to treat dyslipidemia in metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes but also to improve outcomes in diabetic retinopathy where lipid dysregulation, inflammation, and endothelial stress are key pathological features (Dou & Duerfeldt, 2020; Khatol et al., 2018).

Therapeutic History:
Fenofibrate’s use spans several decades in the management of dyslipidemia and associated cardiovascular risk, and its safety profile is well established in both preclinical and clinical settings. Large-scale clinical trials such as the FIELD study and the ACCORD Eye study have demonstrated that fenofibrate significantly slows the progression of diabetic retinopathy and reduces the need for laser treatment in diabetic patients (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2003; Dou & Duerfeldt, 2020). These trials provided indirect evidence that fenofibrate’s lipid-lowering and pleiotropic anti-inflammatory properties can confer retinal benefit even though its primary indication has been for managing systemic dyslipidemia. Although fenofibrate has not been directly approved for the treatment of dry AMD, its mechanism—specifically involving modulation of lipid metabolism in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells—is highly relevant to the pathogenesis of dry AMD. In addition to clinical studies in diabetic retinopathy, preclinical models have explored fenofibrate’s role in attenuating subretinal fibrosis in neovascular AMD (Chen et al., 2020) and its effects on retinal cell survival in models of fatty acid–induced damage (Wang et al., 2023). While there remains a paucity of clinical data specifically addressing dry AMD, the cumulative evidence from diabetic retinopathy and neovascular AMD models suggests that fenofibrate’s bioactivity in the retina extends to modulating pathways central to this degenerative disease (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018; Dou & Duerfeldt, 2020).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, fenofibrate acts as a potent PPARα agonist. PPARα is a nuclear receptor expressed in many tissues, including the liver, adipose tissue, and importantly, the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) (Khatol et al., 2018). Upon activation by ligands such as fenofibrate, PPARα forms a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR), and this complex binds to peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPREs) in the promoter regions of target genes. These target genes include enzymes and transporters central to fatty acid β-oxidation, for example, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A), and lysosomal lipase enzymes such as LIPA, which are important for the degradation of internalized lipids (Dou & Duerfeldt, 2020). Fenofibrate thereby upregulates fatty acid oxidation pathways, enabling improved breakdown and clearance of lipids. In retinal pigment epithelial cells, where phagocytosis and lysosomal degradation of photoreceptor outer segments are critical functions, upregulation of these metabolic pathways could reduce the buildup of toxic lipofuscin and extracellular drusen deposits (Wang et al., 2023).

Furthermore, experimental work in ARPE-19 cell cultures has demonstrated that fenofibrate (and its active metabolite, fenofibric acid) can reduce lipid droplet accumulation—even in the presence of oxidized low-density lipoprotein—by approximately 45% and can improve the degradation of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled photoreceptor outer segments by about 30% (Wang et al., 2023). This indicates that fenofibrate not only enhances β-oxidation but also improves lysosomal lipid hydrolysis—a critical component of the phagocytic clearance machinery in RPE cells. In addition, fenofibrate exerts anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects by downregulating inflammatory mediators such as TNFα, ICAM1, and VEGF as well as reducing oxidative stress markers (Dou & Duerfeldt, 2020; Wang et al., 2023). Notably, the compound has been shown to upregulate the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway—a key cell survival and anti-inflammatory pathway—which further promotes a protective environment within the retina (Wang et al., 2023). This comprehensive action on lipid metabolism, inflammatory signaling, and cell survival provides a strong biochemical rationale for its repurposing in dry AMD, where dysregulated lipid homeostasis in the RPE leads to poor phagocytosis, accumulation of lipofuscin, and subsequent drusen formation (Dou & Duerfeldt, 2020; Fu et al., 2019).

Expected Effect:
Given the hypothesis that fenofibrate will upregulate fatty acid oxidation and modulate lipid homeostasis in RPE cells, the expected experimental outcome would be a significant reduction in lipofuscin accumulation along with enhanced lysosomal degradation of photoreceptor outer segments. In the ARPE-19 cell assay, fenofibrate at a concentration around 50 μM is anticipated to reduce lipid droplet accumulation by nearly 45% and improve FITC-labeled photoreceptor outer segment degradation by about 30% (Wang et al., 2023). The underlying mechanism, as described, involves the upregulation of genes controlled by PPARα, such as CPT1A and LIPA, which contribute to increased β-oxidation and enhanced lysosomal lipid hydrolysis (Dou & Duerfeldt, 2020). In vivo, similar effects are expected to translate into improved retinal pigment epithelium function as measured by improved electroretinogram (ERG) parameters—particularly improvements in the c-wave amplitude—which reflect better RPE and photoreceptor function (Wang et al., 2023). Additionally, fenofibrate’s anti-inflammatory effects may reduce chronic retinal inflammation that exacerbates lipofuscin accumulation and disrupts normal lysosomal activity in aging RPE cells. This systemic modulation of lipid and inflammatory pathways has been indirectly corroborated by clinical findings in diabetic retinopathy, where fenofibrate has been seen to slow disease progression and improve retinal vascular health (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2003; Dou & Duerfeldt, 2020). Given that the RPE is known to express PPARα and that the enzyme is central to the regulation of fatty acid metabolism in these cells (Khatol et al., 2018), the expected effect of fenofibrate in this context is a restoration of lipid homeostasis that ultimately may delay or prevent the pathological cascade leading to dry AMD.

Overall Evaluation:
The collective review of the literature suggests that fenofibrate possesses several attractive attributes as a candidate for repurposing in the treatment of dry AMD. Its established safety profile, widespread clinical use for dyslipidemia, and demonstrated efficacy in slowing diabetic retinopathy progression provide a strong clinical foundation that supports its investigation in retinal diseases (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2003; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018). Mechanistically, fenofibrate’s activation of PPARα leads to upregulation of genes involved in fatty acid β-oxidation and lysosomal lipid metabolism, which are precisely the processes believed to be impaired in the RPE during dry AMD (Dou & Duerfeldt, 2020; Wang et al., 2023). The compound’s pleiotropic actions, including modulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway and suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as TNFα and VEGF), further enhance its therapeutic potential by addressing additional pathogenic factors involved in dry AMD (Wang et al., 2023; Dou & Duerfeldt, 2020). Moreover, preclinical studies in ARPE-19 cell models indicate that fenofibrate can reduce lipid accumulation and improve phagocytic degradation of photoreceptor outer segments—critical end points relevant to the pathogenesis of dry AMD (Wang et al., 2023).

However, there are also weaknesses that warrant consideration. The current body of evidence supporting fenofibrate’s use in dry AMD remains largely indirect; most clinical data to date have been generated in the context of diabetic retinopathy or neovascular retinal disease rather than dry AMD per se. No dedicated clinical trials have yet provided robust evidence of fenofibrate’s efficacy in slowing disease progression specifically in dry AMD patients. Additionally, while the molecular rationale is compelling, direct evidence from animal models of dry AMD evaluating fenofibrate’s effects on RPE lysosomal function, lipofuscin accumulation, and drusen formation is limited in the current literature (Chen et al., 2020; Fu et al., 2019). In other words, although the biochemical and cellular assays are promising, these findings must be translated into relevant in vivo outcomes to fully validate the therapeutic hypothesis. Furthermore, the optimal dosing, delivery route (systemic versus topical ocular formulations), and long-term safety of fenofibrate when used in a predominantly elderly population with dry AMD remain to be determined. These aspects are critical because the elderly may have altered pharmacokinetics and could be at greater risk for side effects even in repurposed indications.

In summary, fenofibrate stands out as a strong repurposing candidate for dry AMD due to its dual action on lipid metabolism and inflammatory pathways, which are central components in the pathophysiology of this disease. Its well-established history in treating dyslipidemia and diabetic retinopathy, combined with promising preclinical data on RPE protection, provide a solid rationale for further development. Nonetheless, the translational gap between the available preclinical data and clinical efficacy in dry AMD remains significant. Addressing this gap will require dedicated preclinical studies using animal models that recapitulate dry AMD pathology and subsequent clinical trials that directly evaluate fenofibrate’s impact on visual function, RPE integrity, lipofuscin deposition, and drusen dynamics. Overall, while the promise is evident, careful evaluation of delivery, dosing, and long-term outcomes will be critical in determining if fenofibrate can successfully restore RPE phagocytic function and prevent retinal degeneration in the context of dry AMD (Dou & Duerfeldt, 2020; Wang et al., 2023; Khatol et al., 2018).
