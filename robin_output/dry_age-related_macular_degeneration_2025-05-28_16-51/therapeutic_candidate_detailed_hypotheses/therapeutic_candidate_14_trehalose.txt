Proposal for Trehalose (Sigma-Aldrich Cat# T9531)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Trehalose is a naturally occurring, non‐reducing disaccharide composed of two glucose molecules, originally discovered in various natural sources such as fungi, plants, and invertebrates. It is produced biotechnologically by the trehalose synthase pathway and has been commonly used as a biochemical stabilizer due to its ability to protect proteins and cellular membranes under stress conditions (Laihia & Kaarniranta, 2020, pp. 20–21). As a sugar-based molecule, trehalose falls under the class of natural osmolytes and chemical chaperones that have been widely exploited in both biomedical and industrial settings. This class of compounds is known for its capacity to stabilize protein conformations, prevent aggregation, and modulate cellular stress responses. Historically, trehalose gained attention in fields such as cryopreservation, formulation of therapeutic proteins, and maintenance of ocular surface homeostasis, thereby establishing its role as a cytoprotective agent with a strong safety profile (Abokyi et al., 2020, pp. 1–2; Laihia & Kaarniranta, 2020, pp. 20–21).

Therapeutic History:
Trehalose’s utility has been documented extensively in biochemical and clinical literature. It is approved by regulatory agencies such as the US FDA and European regulatory bodies as a safe food additive and has been used in various clinical, topical, and veterinary applications. For instance, trehalose has been utilized in treating ocular conditions such as dry eye syndrome and in the postsurgical management of corneal procedures, where its osmoprotectant and protein-stabilizing properties are exploited (Laihia & Kaarniranta, 2020, pp. 20–21). In clinical settings, trehalose has been administered intravenously at high doses for neuromuscular disorders, and its extensive safety record bolsters its candidacy for repurposing in other diseases. While there is no extensive clinical trial data directly associating trehalose administration with the treatment of dry age-related macular degeneration (dry AMD), several preclinical studies have explored its role in enhancing autophagic flux and lysosomal activity. In retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cellular models, trehalose has been shown to reduce the accumulation of toxic aggregates such as p62 and A2E, two key markers associated with dry AMD pathology (Abokyi et al., 2020, pp. 16–17). Furthermore, trehalose has been employed in various preclinical paradigms to counter oxidative damage, suggesting its potential for mitigating the cellular dysfunctions that underpin dry AMD (Abokyi, 2021, pp. 13–15; Abokyi, 2021, pp. 27–32).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, trehalose functions primarily as an inducer of autophagy by promoting the nuclear translocation and activation of the transcription factor EB (TFEB). TFEB is recognized as a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy gene expression—it controls the CLEAR (Coordinated Lysosomal Expression and Regulation) network, which drives the expression of key lysosomal and autophagy‐related genes. The activation of TFEB by trehalose enhances autophagic flux, which is the process by which cells remove damaged proteins and organelles. In multiple RPE cell assays (including those using ARPE‐19 cells), treatment with trehalose has been shown to induce increased expression of autophagy markers such as LC3B, ATG5, ATG7, and LAMP2, as well as to promote the clearance of p62 aggregates (Abokyi et al., 2020, pp. 11–12, 16–17). The molecular interactions involve trehalose’s ability to bypass mTOR inhibition pathways—thus achieving TFEB activation in an mTOR-independent manner—which avoids many of the side effects typically associated with mTOR inhibitors (Ghosh et al., 2024, pp. 10–11). Furthermore, trehalose has been shown to mitigate oxidative stress by restoring the function of the NRF2 antioxidant pathway, even when NRF2 is impaired by external stressors such as hydroquinone (HQ) that simulate cigarette smoke exposure (Abokyi et al., 2020, pp. 12–13). This dual action—activating both autophagy via TFEB and supporting the antioxidant response—suggests that trehalose can counter not only the intracellular accumulation of toxic substances like lipofuscin and undigested photoreceptor outer segments (POS) but also reduce oxidative damage within RPE cells (Abokyi, 2021, pp. 160–165). Additionally, there is emerging evidence that trehalose may positively influence mitochondrial bioenergetics, helping to restore mitochondrial membrane potential and, thereby, improve cellular energy metabolism, which is crucial given the high-energy demands of RPE cells (Ebeling et al., 2022, pp. 15–17). Moreover, by enhancing autophagic clearance, trehalose is thought to indirectly support the function of Mer tyrosine kinase (MerTK), which is critical for the phagocytosis of POS by RPE cells—a process that is typically compromised in dry AMD (Ghosh et al., 2024, pp. 6–8).

Expected Effect:
Based on the hypothesized mechanism, trehalose is expected to exert multifaceted beneficial effects in the context of dry AMD. In vitro assays using RPE cells (e.g., the ARPE-19 cell line) have demonstrated that trehalose treatment results in the nuclear translocation of TFEB and the resultant upregulation of lysosomal and autophagy genes (Abokyi et al., 2020, pp. 11–12, 16–17). This action is directly anticipated to enhance autophagic degradation, thereby reducing the accumulation of lipofuscin—an autofluorescent pigment that accumulates as a result of incomplete digestion of POS and is a key contributor to RPE dysfunction in dry AMD (Abokyi, 2021, pp. 165–170). In parallel, trehalose’s promotion of autophagy is expected to bolster mitochondrial quality control by facilitating the clearance of damaged mitochondria (mitophagy) and restoring mitochondrial function, as evidenced by improved mitochondrial membrane potential and bioenergetic profiles in treated cells (Ebeling et al., 2022, pp. 15–17). This restoration of mitochondrial function is critical for RPE cells, which rely heavily on efficient mitochondrial energy production to sustain the phagocytosis of POS and overall retinal homeostasis.

The compound is also anticipated to improve MerTK-mediated phagocytosis in RPE cells—the receptor process by which RPE cells ingest shed POS—which is essential for retinal health. Activation of TFEB by trehalose enhances lysosomal biogenesis and the overall degradative capacity of the cell, which in turn is hypothesized to improve the efficiency of MerTK-dependent phagocytosis (Ghosh et al., 2024, pp. 6–8). Furthermore, there is evidence suggesting that trehalose treatment results in the reduction of cytotoxic aggregates like p62 and the restoration of cellular proteostasis, factors that are crucial in mitigating cell death induced by chronic oxidative stress (Abokyi et al., 2020, pp. 13–15). The expected effect, therefore, is that trehalose will lead to a net reduction in lipofuscin accumulation, improved clearance of undigested POS, better mitochondrial function, and eventually enhanced phagocytic activity of RPE cells—all of which are beneficial for delaying or reversing the progression of dry AMD (Abokyi, 2021, pp. 27–32; Abokyi, 2025, pp. 7–8).

Overall Evaluation:
In summary, trehalose presents as a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of dry AMD based on its well-documented properties as an autophagy enhancer and lysosomal activator. One of the greatest strengths of trehalose is its dual mechanism of action: it not only activates TFEB—thereby enhancing the autophagy-lysosomal pathway necessary for the clearance of toxic aggregates such as lipofuscin—but also supports mitochondrial function and promotes cellular antioxidant defenses via NRF2 pathways. The fact that trehalose operates in an mTOR-independent manner to activate TFEB circumvents many of the adverse effects typically seen with mTOR inhibitors, offering a safer profile for long-term administration (Ghosh et al., 2024, pp. 10–11). Additionally, its natural, sugar-based structure contributes to a low toxicity profile and favorable pharmacokinetics, and previous uses in ocular formulations and systemic applications provide a strong foundation for its repurposing in dry AMD (Laihia & Kaarniranta, 2020, pp. 20–21).

Furthermore, the ability of trehalose to restore autophagic flux in RPE cells is supported by multiple independent studies, which have demonstrated reduced p62 accumulation, improved lysosomal enzyme function, and enhanced clearance of oxidative debris in preclinical models (Abokyi et al., 2020, pp. 16–17; Abokyi, 2021, pp. 160–165). These effects are particularly relevant in the context of dry AMD, a disease characterized by RPE dysfunction, lipofuscin build-up, and impaired phagocytic clearance of POS. Additionally, the improvement in mitochondrial function observed upon trehalose treatment is a significant advantage because mitochondrial decline is a well-known contributor to RPE degeneration and retinal dysfunction (Ebeling et al., 2022, pp. 15–17).

On the other hand, there are some challenges and weaknesses that must be noted. While the preclinical evidence is compelling, clinical trial data evaluating trehalose specifically in dry AMD patients remain limited, necessitating further translational and clinical research to confirm its efficacy in human subjects. Ocular bioavailability, particularly regarding the optimal route of administration (oral versus intravitreal), remains an area that requires more robust investigation to ensure that sufficient trehalose concentrations can be achieved in the retinal tissue without off-target effects (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In addition, while trehalose’s ability to modulate autophagy is well established, the precise dose-response relationship must be carefully elucidated since higher doses of trehalose have been shown, in some studies, to lead to overactivation of autophagy and even apoptotic cell death in RPE cells (Abokyi et al., 2020, pp. 15–16). This indicates that precise dosing and careful monitoring of autophagic flux will be critical parameters in any future clinical trial.

Moreover, additional mechanistic details need to be addressed, such as confirming trehalose’s effects on MerTK-mediated phagocytosis, which is important for POS clearance, and clarifying its direct impact on lipofuscin degradation and mitochondrial biogenesis beyond improving mitochondrial function. Although current data suggest improvements in these pathways, direct assays demonstrating these outcomes in vivo or in more advanced clinical models are still sparse (Ghosh et al., 2024, pp. 6–8; Abokyi, 2021, pp. 165–170). There is also the challenge of ensuring that the beneficial effects observed in in vitro assays of ARPE-19 cells and preclinical animal models will translate into clinical efficacy in humans, given the complex pathophysiology of dry AMD.

In conclusion, trehalose stands out as a strong candidate for repurposing as a therapeutic for dry AMD due to its ability to activate TFEB and thereby enhance autophagic flux, lysosomal biogenesis, and mitochondrial function. Its ability to facilitate the degradation of lipofuscin and undigested POS, coupled with a favorable safety profile owing to its natural origin and prior use in both clinical and veterinary settings, makes it a particularly attractive intervention (Abokyi, 2025, pp. 7–8; Ghosh et al., 2024, p. 6). Although some limitations exist—namely, the need for further clinical validation and optimization of dosing regimens—trehalose’s robust mechanism of action and preclinical efficacy data warrant its further evaluation in clinical trials targeting dry AMD. Given the substantial unmet therapeutic need in dry AMD and the strong mechanistic underpinnings presented by trehalose’s modulation of the autophagy–lysosome axis, the candidate merits further investigation and development with a focus on precisely defining the dosing, delivery route, and direct clinical outcomes in retinal function improvement (Abokyi, 2021, pp. 27–32; Ebeling et al., 2022, pp. 15–17).

Overall, the strengths of trehalose for dry AMD include its well-documented activation of TFEB leading to enhanced autophagy and lysosomal activity, its potential to restore mitochondrial function and support cellular antioxidant defenses, and its demonstrated safety profile from multiple clinical and veterinary applications. The primary weaknesses are the current lack of direct clinical evidence in dry AMD, the need for optimized dosing to avoid potential overactivation of autophagy, and uncertainties regarding achieving sufficient ocular bioavailability. Addressing these weaknesses through rigorous translational studies and carefully designed clinical trials will be crucial in determining trehalose’s viability as a novel therapeutic intervention for dry AMD.
