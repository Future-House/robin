Proposal for Elamipretide (SS-31; Stealth BioTherapeutics)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Elamipretide (SS-31; Stealth BioTherapeutics) is a synthetic, mitochondria-targeted tetrapeptide belonging to the class of Szeto–Schiller (SS) peptides. Derived from rational design efforts to produce small, cell‐permeable molecules with alternating aromatic and cationic residues, SS-31 was synthesized to preferentially accumulate within the inner mitochondrial membrane where the negative surface charge from cardiolipin drives its localization. As a member of a novel therapeutic class, these mitochondria-targeted peptides have been explored for their ability to modulate mitochondrial membrane electrostatics, stabilize mitochondrial structure, and reduce oxidative stress in a range of disease models. The compound’s synthetic origins allow for precise modulation of its structure–activity relationships, and its amphipathic nature facilitates its rapid uptake into mitochondria. In general, analogous compounds in this class have been investigated for applications across cardiomyopathy, neurodegeneration, and ischemia–reperfusion injury due to their capacity to restore mitochondrial bioenergetics and mitigate oxidative damage (Ji et al., 2021; Nashine, 2021).

Therapeutic History:
Elamipretide has undergone extensive preclinical evaluations based on its ability to restore mitochondrial function and protect against oxidative injury. In biochemical and cellular assays, studies have demonstrated that SS-31 effectively stabilizes mitochondrial cristae, reduces cardiolipin oxidation, and lowers reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in various cell types, including retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells under oxidative stress. Historical applications of SS-31 include research in animal models of aging, where mitochondrial dysfunction is a key pathological component, and preclinical studies have shown improvements in ATP production as well as reductions in intracellular markers of oxidative stress. Moreover, early-phase clinical evaluations, including the ReCLAIM trial in dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients with high-risk drusen or noncentral geographic atrophy (GA), have suggested a favorable safety and tolerability profile alongside hints of functional benefit measured by improvements in visual acuity metrics (Ammar et al., 2020; Guimaraes et al., 2022; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In addition, SS-31 has been evaluated in preclinical models where delivery via subconjunctival or systemic routes achieved measurable retinal effects; these studies have shown that improvements in mitochondrial bioenergetics can lead to downstream benefits in retinal function, supporting its potential repurposing for dry AMD—a condition characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction and RPE cell degeneration (Alam et al., 2020; Tong et al., 2022).

Mechanism of Action:
The known mechanism of SS-31 is based on its high-affinity binding to cardiolipin, a phospholipid uniquely located in the inner mitochondrial membrane that is essential to maintaining the structural integrity of cristae and the efficiency of the electron transport chain. By binding cardiolipin, SS-31 prevents its peroxidation—a critical step in the cascade that typically leads to mitochondrial membrane destabilization, impaired oxidative phosphorylation, and increased ROS generation. At the molecular level, SS-31 modulates mitochondrial membrane electrostatics and stabilizes the cytochrome c/cardiolipin complex, thereby reducing cytochrome c release and subsequent activation of apoptotic pathways. These actions result in improved electron transport chain efficiency, enhanced ATP synthesis, and decreased mitochondrial depolarization. In parallel, SS-31’s reduction of ROS production indirectly benefits the autophagy–lysosome machinery and phagocytic capacity of RPE cells, where chronic oxidative stress has been implicated in the accumulation of lipofuscin and other degenerative deposits. By preserving mitochondrial function and promoting healthier bioenergetic conditions, this peptide theoretically contributes to enhanced proteostasis and normalization of phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) in the RPE. Biochemical assays in AMD cybrid RPE models have demonstrated that treatment with SS-31 results in improved mitochondrial membrane potential and reduced markers of oxidative damage, supporting its mode of action at the subcellular level (Ferrington et al., 2020; Mitchell et al., 2019; Nashine, 2021).

Expected Effect:
It is hypothesized that SS-31 will exert multiple beneficial effects on the RPE cells of dry AMD patients by directly targeting mitochondrial dysfunction. In the context of in vitro assays and animal models, the treatment is expected to yield several key outcomes. First, the peptide should stabilize cardiolipin, thereby preserving cristae structure and maintaining the integrity of the electron transport chain. This would result in improved ATP production and a reduction in intracellular ROS levels—a critical factor given that excessive ROS contribute to the damage of RPE cellular components and the cascading failure of cellular homeostasis. Second, with sustained improvements in mitochondrial bioenergetics, SS-31 is anticipated to indirectly enhance autophagy–lysosome processes, facilitating more efficient clearance of damaged proteins and lipid aggregates such as lipofuscin, which is known to accumulate in the RPE with age and contribute to dry AMD pathology. Third, restoration of normal mitochondrial function is expected to promote robust POS phagocytic processes by RPE cells, thereby addressing one of the hypothesized mechanisms underlying photoreceptor degeneration in AMD. In preclinical animal models, both systemic and subconjunctival delivery of SS-31 have produced measurable retinal benefits, including improved visual function outcomes such as enhanced photopic acuity and contrast sensitivity. On a molecular level, there is evidence indicating that mitochondrial stabilization leads to downstream improvements in cellular signaling pathways that regulate autophagic flux and inflammatory responses, which are essential in preventing RPE cell degeneration (Tong et al., 2022; Nashine, 2021; Rubner et al., 2022). Given that studies in AMD cybrids have demonstrated normalization of mitochondrial markers after treatment with SS-31, the expected effect in clinical terms would translate into slowed progression of atrophic changes, reduced drusen accumulation, and ultimately, preservation of visual function in dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Overall Evaluation:
Elamipretide represents a promising therapeutic candidate for dry AMD owing to its specific targeting of mitochondrial dysfunction—a central pathological mechanism in RPE degeneration. One of the key strengths of SS-31 lies in its well-characterized mechanism of action; its ability to bind cardiolipin and modulate mitochondrial membrane properties has been robustly demonstrated in multiple biochemical studies, and this underpins its capacity to restore electron transport efficiency, boost ATP production, and lower oxidative stress. The favorable safety profile observed in early-phase clinical trials, including studies using subcutaneous administration routes in AMD patients, further supports its potential for repurposing in this indication (Ammar et al., 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Ji et al., 2021).

However, there are also notable challenges and weaknesses that must be considered. Despite encouraging preclinical data, some clinical trials—such as those evaluating visual function endpoints in dry AMD patients—have reported mixed outcomes, with certain endpoints not being met as robustly as expected (Lin et al., 2022). Moreover, the translational gap between animal models and human disease remains a critical hurdle, as the complex interplay of mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and impaired autophagy in RPE cells may not be fully recapitulated in preclinical systems. In addition, while the direct biochemical effects of SS-31 on mitochondrial parameters are well supported in vitro, the long-term impact on the clinical progression of dry AMD, including endpoints such as geographic atrophy progression and visual acuity improvement, still requires definitive large-scale, randomized clinical trials for conclusive evidence (Fisher, 2022; Guimaraes et al., 2022).
Another potential limitation is the challenge of drug delivery to the retina. While studies have shown that both systemic and subconjunctival administration can achieve retinal tissue levels sufficient to exert biological effects, optimizing dosing regimens and ensuring consistent distribution to the RPE remain critical factors for clinical success. In addition, the modulation of autophagy and phagocytosis by SS-31, while supported by mechanistic rationale, is an indirect effect that may vary based on inter-patient variability in mitochondrial function and cellular stress levels.

In summary, Elamipretide’s potential for treating dry AMD is supported by a strong mechanistic rationale that directly addresses mitochondrial dysfunction—a hallmark of RPE pathology in this disease. Its synthetic design as a mitochondria-targeted peptide allows for precise action on cardiolipin stabilization, leading to improved mitochondrial integrity, reduced ROS production, and enhanced ATP synthesis. These biochemical and cellular improvements are expected to translate into clinical benefits such as slowed progression of atrophic retinal degeneration and preservation of visual function. Preclinical models and early-phase clinical studies provide promising evidence, although the mixed outcomes observed in some clinical endpoints underscore the need for further research. Overall, the strengths of SS-31, including its well-understood mechanism, favorable safety profile, and documented efficacy in mitigating mitochondrial defects in RPE cells, render it a strong candidate for repurposing in dry AMD. Nevertheless, additional large-scale clinical trials are warranted to definitively confirm its therapeutic efficacy, optimize dosing strategies, and address the inherent challenges in drug delivery to the retina (Nashine, 2021; Mitchell et al., 2021; Ferrington et al., 2020).
