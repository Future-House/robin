Proposal for Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is a naturally occurring long‐chain omega‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acid that was originally identified and isolated from fish oil and marine algae; its discovery followed extensive biochemical research into essential fatty acids required for neural and retinal development (Bazan, Molina, & Gordon, 2011). DHA belongs to the class of omega‐3 fatty acids, which are critical structural components of cell membranes, particularly in the central nervous system and the retina, where they contribute to membrane fluidity, receptor organization, and intracellular signaling (Bazan et al., 2011). Broadly, omega‐3 fatty acids have been used for centuries as nutritional supplements to maintain cardiovascular, neurological, and ocular health, and DHA in particular has been shown to play a pivotal role in neuroprotection and cell survival, a profile that has generated interest in using it as a therapeutic candidate for neurodegenerative conditions (Lawrenson & Evans, 2015). Its natural origin from fish oil – available commercially as purified or concentrated formulations such as Sigma-Aldrich catalog #50692 – and its well‐characterized safety profile have made DHA a leading candidate for repurposing to treat dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) through enhancement of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) function and photoreceptor survival (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
DHA has a rich therapeutic history, with extensive use and investigation in both clinical and preclinical settings. Historically, DHA supplementation has been explored in ophthalmology for retinal degenerative diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and age‐related macular degeneration (AMD), as evidenced by clinical trials including NCT00060749, NCT00100230, and the AREDS2 study (National Eye Institute, 2003; Hoffman, 2004; National Eye Institute, 2006). In addition to its use in human clinical studies, DHA has also been administered in veterinary contexts where its importance in retinal development and neuroprotection has been highlighted, demonstrating preservation of photoreceptor structure and function in animal models fed omega-3 enriched diets (Tuo et al., 2009). Preclinical studies in murine models – such as those using Ccl2/Cx3cr1-deficient mice that mimic features of AMD – have demonstrated that diets enriched with DHA result in improved RPE phagocytosis, reduced accumulation of toxic lipofuscin derivatives like A2E, and a slowing of photoreceptor degeneration (Ramkumar et al., 2013; Tuo et al., 2009). While most clinical evidence in AMD populations is indirect, epidemiological studies and observational data from trials like AREDS2 suggest that higher dietary intakes of DHA correlate with reduced progression of dry AMD, supporting the hypothesis that DHA supplementation may yield benefits in this patient population (Lee, Lee, Zhang, & Zhou, 2024).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, DHA’s mechanism of action is multifaceted and centers on its incorporation into cell membranes, where it modulates lipid raft microdomains and the function of key receptor proteins. Biochemically, DHA is esterified at the sn-2 position of phospholipids and becomes a critical part of the RPE cell membrane; its unique physical properties contribute to increased membrane fluidity and the formation of specialized lipid domains necessary for receptor clustering (Bazan et al., 2011). This remodeling of the membrane is hypothesized to enhance the activity of receptor tyrosine kinases such as MerTK, which are essential for the phagocytic uptake of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) by RPE cells. In vitro studies have shown that when RPE cell cultures are supplemented with DHA at concentrations of 50 μM, there is a notable increase of approximately 60% in MerTK phosphorylation at tyrosine residue Y749, which is critical for initiating intracellular signaling cascades that promote efficient phagocytosis (Bazan et al., 2011). This receptor activation is facilitated by the interaction with Gas6, a ligand that binds MerTK to trigger its clustering within DHA-rich membrane domains, thereby accelerating the internalization of POS by 35% as measured by assays employing FITC-labeled POS (Bazan et al., 2011). Beyond receptor activation, DHA also serves as a substrate for the production of bioactive mediators, such as neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1), which has potent anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects; NPD1 has been shown to upregulate antiapoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL) and downregulate proapoptotic proteins in RPE cells under oxidative stress, further contributing to retinal protection (Bazan et al., 2011). Additionally, DHA’s incorporation into RPE membranes is linked to enhanced phagolysosome trafficking, facilitating the degradation and clearance of accumulated POS debris; this process is critical because defective phagocytosis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of dry AMD through the buildup of toxic cellular waste products that can lead to photoreceptor degeneration (Kaarniranta et al., 2019). Collectively, these mechanistic insights explain how DHA not only structurally integrates into retinal membranes but also biochemically orchestrates intracellular signaling events that support RPE health and photoreceptor viability.

Expected Effect:
In the proposed assay, DHA supplementation is expected to yield measurable improvements in RPE phagocytic function through both receptor activation and intracellular trafficking enhancements. Specifically, the hypothesis posits that adding DHA to RPE cell cultures at 50 μM will result in enhanced clustering of MerTK receptors in lipid raft domains, leading to a 60% increase in MerTK Y749 phosphorylation; this is known to be a critical modification that triggers downstream signaling pathways necessary for efficient phagocytosis (Bazan et al., 2011). As a result, a 35% increase in FITC-POS internalization is anticipated, which reflects improved uptake of photoreceptor outer segments by RPE cells; this effect is further expected to be accompanied by accelerated phagolysosome trafficking, ensuring that internalized debris is promptly degraded and disposed of (Lee et al., 2024). Animal models of retinal degeneration – where DHA-enriched diets have been shown to reduce the accumulation of lipofuscin and preserve photoreceptor structure – lend robust preclinical support to this expected outcome (Tuo et al., 2009; Ramkumar et al., 2013). Moreover, clinical evidence from observational studies and the AREDS2 trial has linked higher dietary DHA intake with a slower progression of AMD, thereby corroborating the therapeutic rationale that improving RPE phagocytosis via DHA-mediated modulation of MerTK signaling will translate to better retinal outcomes in dry AMD patients (Lee et al., 2024; National Eye Institute, 2006). Given that RPE cells are a critical component of retinal homeostasis—responsible for the daily clearance of shed photoreceptor outer segments—the anticipated increase in phagocytic activity should help maintain photoreceptor integrity and function, ultimately reducing the degenerative changes characteristic of dry AMD (Kaarniranta et al., 2019).

Overall Evaluation:
Based on comprehensive literature review across biochemical, clinical, and preclinical studies, the therapeutic candidate DHA presents a promising potential for repurposing in the treatment of dry age-related macular degeneration. One of the key strengths of DHA is its well-documented natural occurrence and essential role in retinal and neural health, lending inherent safety and a robust historical background in both dietary supplementation and therapeutic applications (Bazan et al., 2011; Lawrenson & Evans, 2015). The evidence supporting DHA’s mechanism of action—its capacity to incorporate into the RPE cell membranes, enhance membrane fluidity, and promote the clustering and phosphorylation of MerTK receptors—is compelling and grounded in rigorous biochemical studies (Bazan et al., 2011). Additionally, the observed increase in phagocytic uptake and accelerated lysosomal trafficking in RPE cultures supplemented with DHA underscores the direct functional benefits that can be expected from modulating this crucial receptor pathway (Bazan et al., 2011). Preclinical animal studies further bolster this candidate’s profile, demonstrating that diets enriched in DHA lead to reduced accumulation of degenerative markers such as lipofuscin and improved photoreceptor survival in models that mimic dry AMD (Tuo et al., 2009; Ramkumar et al., 2013). Moreover, epidemiological data and clinical trials such as AREDS2 indicate that higher dietary intake of DHA is associated with a reduced progression of AMD, adding an important clinical dimension to the proposed mechanism (National Eye Institute, 2006; Lee et al., 2024).

A notable strength of DHA is its dual role as an essential membrane lipid and as a precursor to bioactive signaling molecules like neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1), which amplify its neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects. This multi-pronged mechanism not only supports photoreceptor health by enhancing the physical properties of the cell membrane but also by directly mitigating oxidative stress and inflammation in the RPE (Bazan et al., 2011). In the context of dry AMD, where RPE dysfunction and impaired phagocytosis are central to disease progression, these effects are particularly advantageous. The proposed drug candidate benefits from decades of supportive research across multiple domains; however, certain inherent weaknesses must also be acknowledged.

One potential limitation is the variability of clinical outcomes observed in trials assessing DHA supplementation for AMD, with some studies reporting mixed or inconclusive benefits when administered as part of multi-nutrient formulations (National Eye Institute, 2006; Jiang et al., 2024). This underscores the challenge of isolating the precise contribution of DHA from other components and suggests that dose optimization and patient selection may be critical determinants of efficacy. Additionally, while in vitro data and animal models provide strong mechanistic evidence, the extrapolation of these effects to human patients remains tentative pending further well-powered randomized controlled trials specifically targeting dry AMD (Ramkumar et al., 2013; Sacu, 2015). Furthermore, potential issues related to long-term bioavailability, metabolism, and the integration of DHA into the complex lipid environment of the human retina require additional scrutiny (Bazan et al., 2011).

Despite these challenges, the overall evaluation of DHA as a therapeutic candidate for dry AMD is positive. Its natural origin, established safety profile, and multiple converging lines of evidence—from molecular mechanistic studies to epidemiological observations—support its further investigation and development as a treatment modality aimed at preserving RPE phagocytic function and photoreceptor viability. The specific hypothesis that DHA supplementation will enhance MerTK receptor clustering and activation, leading to improved clearance of photoreceptor outer segments, is strongly backed by both in vitro data showing increased MerTK phosphorylation and corresponding functional assays of POS internalization (Bazan et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2024). In view of the progressive and currently untreatable nature of dry AMD, pursuing DHA as a repurposed drug candidate represents a rational and promising strategy that merits further clinical evaluation in well-designed, large-scale trials.

In conclusion, DHA offers a compelling therapeutic candidate for dry AMD owing to its dual function as a critical membrane lipid and a precursor to neuroprotective mediators, its capacity to modulate MerTK signaling and enhance RPE phagocytic activity, and the supportive evidence from preclinical models and clinical observational studies. Its strengths include an excellent safety record, detailed mechanistic insights, and documented beneficial effects on retinal cell health, while its weaknesses lie in the need for further clinical validation and dosage optimization. Given these considerations, DHA stands out as a promising repurposed drug candidate with the potential to address the underlying cellular dysfunctions in dry AMD, and it should be prioritized for further preclinical studies and targeted clinical trials aimed at definitively establishing its efficacy in improving retinal outcomes (Bazan et al., 2011; Georgiou, Neokleous, Nicolaou, & Sears, 2014; Sacu, 2015).
