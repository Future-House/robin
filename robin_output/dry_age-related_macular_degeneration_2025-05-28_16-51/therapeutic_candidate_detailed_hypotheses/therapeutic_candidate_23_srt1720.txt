Proposal for SRT1720 (SIRT1 activator; Cayman Chemical Cat# 12054)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
SRT1720 is a synthetic small molecule classified as a SIRT1‐activating compound (STAC) that was discovered through high‐throughput screening methods using fluorophore‐tagged peptide substrates (Milne et al., 2007). It belongs to the class of sirtuin activators that are designed to mimic the beneficial effects of caloric restriction by enhancing the activity of SIRT1, a NAD⁺‐dependent deacetylase implicated in longevity, metabolism, and cellular stress responses (Camins et al., 2010). SRT1720, structurally unrelated to natural polyphenols like resveratrol, was synthesized to overcome the poor bioavailability and off‐target effects associated with natural compounds, and its chemical optimization has yielded a candidate that reportedly enhances SIRT1 enzymatic activity by over 100-fold in in vitro biochemical assays (Baur, 2010). As part of a wider drug class that has been explored for metabolic diseases, cancer, and aging, sirtuin activators such as SRT1720 have been used in various preclinical studies to assess their impact on mitochondrial function and oxidative stress responses, which are critical to maintaining cellular homeostasis (Granchi & Minutolo, 2018).

Therapeutic History:
Biochemically, SRT1720 has been evaluated in several animal models, particularly in the context of metabolic dysfunction. Preclinical studies in obese rodent models have demonstrated that oral SRT1720 dosing improves glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and mitochondrial respiration in tissues like liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue (Wan, 2021). Although its initial evaluation was primarily focused on metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, additional research suggested potential anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic benefits in other degenerative conditions (Giblin Jr., 2017). While there is no direct record of SRT1720 having been used clinically in dry age-related macular degeneration (dry AMD), its mechanism of improving mitochondrial function and reducing oxidative stress has led research teams to propose its repurposing for retinal diseases such as dry AMD, given that similar mitochondrial and oxidative injury pathways drive retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) degeneration (Golestaneh et al., 2016; Buonfiglio et al., 2024). Previous experimental studies employing ARPE-19 cells have shown that SIRT1 activation can reduce p62 levels and increase LC3-II accumulation under stress conditions, consistent with improved autophagy, although these findings are more established for natural activators like resveratrol rather than SRT1720 itself (Balaiya et al., 2017). Nonetheless, the metabolic benefits observed in non-ocular models provided the rationale for evaluating SRT1720 in ocular disease models, aligning with evidence that SIRT1 activation supports RPE health by deacetylating key proteins such as PGC-1α and FoxO3a (Fang et al., 2021).

Mechanism of Action:
SRT1720 is designed to activate SIRT1 by binding allosterically to the SIRT1–substrate complex, thereby lowering the Michaelis constant (K_m) for both the acetylated substrates and NAD⁺, which enhances the catalytic efficiency of SIRT1 (Milne et al., 2007; Sinclair & Hubbard, 2013). The biochemical mechanism is thought to involve deacetylation of critical substrates such as PGC-1α and FoxO transcription factors; PGC-1α, in turn, is a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, while FoxO3a modulates cellular stress responses and autophagy (Golestaneh et al., 2016; Camins et al., 2010). Activation of SIRT1 leads to the deacetylation of PGC-1α, enhancing its transcriptional activity, which results in increased expression of genes involved in mitochondrial replication and oxidative phosphorylation, thereby boosting cellular energy production (He, 2010). In addition, deacetylation of FoxO3a promotes autophagy—a critical mechanism for the clearance of damaged proteins and organelles—and enhances the antioxidant response, both of which are essential for maintaining RPE cell function under chronic oxidative stress conditions (Balaiya et al., 2017; Fang et al., 2021). SRT1720’s mechanism may also indirectly influence metabolic pathways by modulating insulin sensitivity and inflammatory cytokine production through SIRT1-dependent inhibition of NF-κB, although some controversies remain regarding whether SRT1720 acts exclusively through direct SIRT1 activation or via off-target effects such as AMPK activation (Sinclair & Hubbard, 2013; Pacholec et al., 2010).

Expected Effect:
In the context of dry AMD, the primary hypothesis is that SRT1720-induced SIRT1 activation will lead to the deacetylation of PGC-1α, which will then upregulate mitochondrial biogenesis and enhance cellular ATP production within RPE cells (Golestaneh et al., 2016). By promoting the activity of FoxO3a, SRT1720 is also expected to trigger autophagic pathways that clear cellular debris, thereby reducing p62 accumulation and increasing LC3-II, markers consistent with active autophagy (Balaiya et al., 2017). This consequent improvement in autophagy, in conjunction with enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, should theoretically ameliorate oxidative stress—a major driver of RPE degeneration and a hallmark of dry AMD (Fang et al., 2021; Luján et al., 2022). There is experimental evidence from ARPE-19 cell studies suggesting that SIRT1 activation can restore aspects of RPE phagocytic function and mitigate stress-induced damage (Balaiya et al., 2017), which directly supports the underlying hypothesis that SRT1720 will improve RPE viability and function in dry AMD assays. The expected effect is that, following oral dosing, SRT1720 will achieve plasma levels sufficient to exert these cellular effects in the rodent retina, thus offering a targeted intervention that addresses energy deficits, oxidative damage, and dysfunctional autophagy in the RPE (Wan, 2021).

Overall Evaluation:
The overall evaluation of SRT1720 as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry AMD is cautiously optimistic. On the strengths side, SRT1720 offers a mechanistically precise intervention by targeting the SIRT1/PGC-1α/FoxO3a axis, which is central to mitochondrial biogenesis, autophagy, and oxidative stress responses—all pathological processes implicated in the degeneration of RPE cells in dry AMD (Golestaneh et al., 2016; Fang et al., 2021). The compound’s high in vitro potency, with reported over 100-fold activation of SIRT1 compared to natural activators, lends strong biochemical rationale to its proposed benefits (Milne et al., 2007). Furthermore, preclinical data demonstrating improvements in mitochondrial function and anti-inflammatory effects in metabolic disease models reinforce the potential for SRT1720 to address the energy deficits and oxidative damage characteristic of dry AMD (Wan, 2021; Modi, 2018). However, there are notable weaknesses and limitations. First, despite promising in vitro data, some studies have raised concerns that SRT1720 may not directly activate SIRT1 when using native substrates, and its biochemical effects may be subject to assay artifacts (Pacholec et al., 2010), necessitating further validation in ocular-specific models. Second, while the data in metabolic and cancer models are encouraging, there is a lack of direct clinical evidence in dry AMD or even in retinal pigment epithelium cells, meaning that extrapolation from non-ocular systems remains speculative (Mimura et al., 2013; Golestaneh et al., 2016). Third, potential off-target effects—such as inadvertent activation of AMPK or inhibition of phosphodiesterases—could complicate the pharmacodynamic profile of SRT1720 (Sinclair & Hubbard, 2013; Park et al., 2017). Additionally, issues regarding the bioavailability of SRT1720 in ocular tissues have yet to be definitively addressed, although preliminary reports indicate that oral dosing can achieve plasma levels active in rodent retina (Wan, 2021). Finally, the complexity of dry AMD pathogenesis—where multiple interconnected pathways contribute to RPE dysfunction—means that the therapeutic efficacy of a single-target intervention such as SRT1720 may only be partial unless used in combination with other treatments (Buonfiglio et al., 2024).

In summary, the literature review indicates that SRT1720 represents a promising, mechanistically justified candidate for repurposing in dry AMD by virtue of its potent activation of SIRT1 and the downstream engagement of mitochondrial biogenesis and autophagic processes critical to RPE health (Golestaneh et al., 2016; Fang et al., 2021). Its synthetic origin and improved potency over natural compounds such as resveratrol make it an attractive option for targeting the energy and clearance deficits observed in dry AMD (Camins et al., 2010; Baur, 2010). Nevertheless, the limitations concerning the direct activation mechanism, potential off-target effects, and the need for corroborative studies in retinal models necessitate further rigorous experimental and preclinical evaluation before advancing to clinical studies in dry AMD patients (Pacholec et al., 2010; Mimura et al., 2013). Overall, SRT1720 has potential as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry AMD if its efficacy and safety in RPE cells and in vivo retinal models can be conclusively demonstrated, thereby paving the way for targeted intervention against the mitochondrial and oxidative pathological mechanisms underlying dry AMD (Balaiya et al., 2017; Fang et al., 2021).
