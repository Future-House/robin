Proposal for SR9011 (agonist of REV-ERBα/β; Cayman Chemical Cat# 17307)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
SR9011 is a synthetic agonist targeting the nuclear receptors REV-ERBα and REV-ERBβ that was derived and optimized from earlier chemical scaffolds such as GSK4112 through structure–activity relationship studies, resulting in compounds with higher potency and improved pharmacokinetic properties (Kojetin & Burris, 2014). It belongs to the class of synthetic nuclear receptor modulators, a group of compounds that have been broadly employed in research to modulate circadian rhythm, lipid metabolism, and inflammatory responses in various tissues (Kojetin & Burris, 2014). The chemical synthesis of SR9011 involves modifications that enhance its receptor-binding affinity and metabolic stability, leading to in vivo efficacy when administered at doses in the range of 50–100 mg/kg in rodent preclinical studies (Huang et al., 2022). This compound is also known to exhibit a greater potency at REV-ERBβ relative to SR9009, thereby offering a broader engagement with the REV-ERB family while preserving the mechanistic specificity of receptor activation (Zhang-sun et al., 2023).

Therapeutic History:
The REV-ERB agonist class, including compounds such as SR9009 and SR9011, has been extensively investigated in preclinical studies addressing circadian rhythm regulation, metabolic diseases, and inflammatory pathologies (Kojetin & Burris, 2014). Although these compounds were originally developed to modulate metabolic processes and circadian parameters in cancer models, obesity, and cardiovascular conditions (Wang et al., 2020), emerging evidence has demonstrated their potential cytoprotective effects in cellular models that mimic oxidative stress conditions, particularly in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells (Huang et al., 2022). Several studies have shown that pharmacological activation of REV-ERBα by agonists can protect RPE cells from oxidative damage and age-related degeneration by upregulating antioxidant gene expression and improving mitochondrial function, which are hallmarks of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (Huang et al., 2022). While direct clinical use of SR9011 specifically for dry AMD has not yet been documented in the literature or clinical trial databases, the extensive preclinical research and the broad scientific interest in using REV-ERB agonists in retinal degeneration models (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.) provide a compelling rationale for advanced investigation in this indication.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, REV-ERBα is an orphan nuclear receptor that normally functions as a transcriptional repressor by pairing with corepressor complexes such as NCOR and HDAC3, thereby regulating circadian genes and various metabolic pathways (Kojetin & Burris, 2014). However, recent research in RPE cells reveals that REV-ERBα can act in a redox-sensitive capacity to transcriptionally activate NFE2L2, the gene that encodes the master antioxidant regulator NRF2 (Huang et al., 2022). SR9011’s dual activation of REV-ERBα and REV-ERBβ is therefore expected to potentiate NRF2-driven antioxidant defenses by increasing the transcription of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD1, SOD2) and catalase, thereby reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in the RPE under oxidative stress (Huang et al., 2022). This agonism not only promotes enhanced antioxidant capacity but also influences mitochondrial protection by normalizing mitochondrial respiration, as evidenced by improved oxygen consumption rates and healthier mitochondrial morphology in RPE cells treated with REV-ERB agonists (Huang et al., 2022). Moreover, REV-ERB activation has been implicated in facilitating autophagic turnover, which can boost the clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) via MerTK/αvβ5-dependent phagocytosis; this is critical because RPE phagocytic dysfunction is a key pathogenic event in dry AMD (Huang et al., 2022). Additionally, the molecular interactions of SR9011 with REV-ERBα/β induce cytoskeletal rearrangements that are necessary for the enhancement of phagocytosis, contributing to the restoration of RPE functionality (Huang et al., 2022).

Expected Effect:
Based on the working hypothesis, SR9011-mediated dual activation of REV-ERBα and REV-ERBβ in oxidative stress–challenged RPE cells is anticipated to produce a synergistic enhancement of NRF2-driven antioxidant defenses. In such a cellular environment, increased NRF2 activity would lead to the upregulation of detoxifying enzymes and enhanced quenching of ROS, thereby mitigating the oxidative stress that contributes to RPE degeneration in dry AMD (Huang et al., 2022). The normalization of mitochondrial respiration is further expected through improved mitochondrial biogenesis and function, as REV-ERB agonists have been shown to modulate mitochondrial oxidative capacity in various tissues (Woldt et al., 2013). With respect to POS clearance, SR9011 is hypothesized to potentiate phagocytosis by stimulating downstream signaling routes involving MerTK and αvβ5 integrin; this would be facilitated by boosting autophagic turnover and reorganization of the cytoskeleton, thereby preventing the accumulation of photoreceptor debris that is characteristic of dry AMD (Huang et al., 2022). The compound’s efficacy has been preliminarily supported by preclinical observations in both in vitro RPE models and in vivo rodent studies, where dosing regimens of 50–100 mg/kg have demonstrated significant cytoprotection without systemic toxicity, indicating a favorable therapeutic index (Huang et al., 2022). Furthermore, gene expression analyses in these studies have corroborated the presence of high levels of REV-ERBα in RPE cells, underpinning the relevance of targeting this receptor for antioxidant defense and phagocytic maintenance (Huang et al., 2022).

Overall Evaluation:
SR9011 presents as a promising therapeutic candidate for dry age-related macular degeneration due to its multifaceted mechanism of action and potent preclinical efficacy in RPE models. One of the main strengths of SR9011 is its dual activation of REV-ERBα and REV-ERBβ, which leverages the intrinsic redundancy and complementary functions of these nuclear receptors to maximize the upregulation of NRF2-mediated antioxidant defense while simultaneously optimizing mitochondrial respiration and phagocytic clearance (Zhang-sun et al., 2023). This dual-engagement strategy not only offers a novel approach to account for the complex pathophysiology of dry AMD, where oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and defective phagocytosis play intertwined roles, but also confers a mechanistic novelty that is superior to earlier REV-ERB agonists with more limited receptor specificity (Huang et al., 2022).

From a biochemical standpoint, the mode of action of SR9011 is well-aligned with the endogenous protective pathways in RPE cells. Its ability to transcriptionally activate NFE2L2 and consequently boost the production of critical antioxidant enzymes is a significant advantage because NRF2 is a key mediator of cytoprotection against oxidative insults—a fundamental pathogenic mechanism in dry AMD (Huang et al., 2022). Additionally, the improvement in mitochondrial respiration observed following SR9011 treatment addresses another major contributor to RPE degeneration, as mitochondrial insufficiency and impaired ATP production jeopardize the overall cellular viability of the RPE (Huang et al., 2022). The compound’s anticipated effect on promoting autophagic turnover and enhancing phagocytosis through MerTK/αvβ5-dependent pathways is particularly critical because the efficient clearance of POS is essential for maintaining retinal homeostasis and preventing the accumulation of toxic debris that leads to drusen formation in dry AMD (Huang et al., 2022).

Despite these strengths, there are also potential weaknesses and challenges that must be addressed. One concern is the risk of off-target effects associated with synthetic REV-ERB agonists, as some compounds in this class have been linked to interactions with receptors outside the intended REV-ERB family, such as LXRα, which could complicate the pharmacological profile and adversely affect safety (Zhang-sun et al., 2023). Although SR9011 is cited as having higher potency and a favorable systemic toxicity profile in preclinical rodent models (Huang et al., 2022), its safety and selectivity will need to be thoroughly evaluated in extended toxicology studies and in different species before clinical translation can be confidently pursued. There is also the challenge of ensuring robust and consistent activation of NRF2 in the RPE, given that the precise interplay between REV-ERB activation and NRF2 signaling might be influenced by the oxidative state of the cells and other context-dependent factors (Huang et al., 2022). Furthermore, while preliminary data support the role of REV-ERB agonists in enhancing POS phagocytosis, the detailed mechanisms underlying the cytoskeletal rearrangements and autophagic processes remain to be fully elucidated, which may require further mechanistic studies to optimize dosing regimens and to anticipate long-term effects in chronic disease models (Huang et al., 2022).

In summary, SR9011 is an advanced synthetic REV-ERB agonist with a strong preclinical rationale for use in dry age-related macular degeneration based on its comprehensive mechanism of action. It acts as a potent activator of REV-ERBα/β, thereby enhancing NRF2-driven antioxidant defenses, normalizing mitochondrial respiration, and facilitating the phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments in RPE cells. This multi-targeted mechanism addresses several key pathological features of dry AMD, including oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impaired clearance of cellular debris (Huang et al., 2022). The compound’s demonstrated efficacy at preclinical doses, combined with its improved receptor engagement and favorable safety profile in rodents, underscores its potential as an optimized therapeutic candidate for clinical development in dry AMD. However, further studies are warranted to conclusively address any off-target effects, validate its mechanistic pathways in more complex in vivo models, and confirm its long-term safety profile. Overall, the dual-action characteristics and mechanistic specificity of SR9011 make it a particularly attractive candidate for repurposing in the treatment of dry AMD, meriting further investigation in advanced preclinical and eventual clinical studies (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).
