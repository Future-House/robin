Proposal for Avacincaptad pegol (Zimura; Iveric Bio)

Below is a comprehensive literature review evaluating avacincaptad pegol (Zimura) as a therapeutic candidate for dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD), with particular focus on its role in slowing the progression of geographic atrophy (GA). The review is organized into five primary sections: an overview of the therapeutic candidate, a review of its therapeutic history, a detailed discussion of its mechanism of action, a description of its expected effects, and an overall evaluation of its potential in treating dry AMD.

• Overview of Therapeutic Candidate
Avacincaptad pegol, marketed under the trade name Zimura, is a synthetically generated RNA aptamer designed with high binding specificity to complement component C5. This drug candidate is produced by Iveric Bio, an Astellas company, and has been optimized via PEGylation—a process in which a polyethylene glycol (PEG) moiety is attached to the aptamer. This modification significantly enhances drug stability and prolongs the half‐life of the molecule in the ocular milieu following intravitreal administration. Because intravitreal injection allows the agent to bypass the blood–retinal barrier and achieve high local concentrations in the posterior segment of the eye, this targeted delivery route ensures that avacincaptad pegol can effectively engage its intended target in the retina over extended intervals (Kang, 2023; Danzig et al., 2024). As an RNA aptamer, this agent belongs to a class of nucleic acid–based therapeutics that are known for their capacity to bind specific proteins with high affinity and precision. In contrast to antibody‐based drugs, RNA aptamers offer advantages such as lower immunogenicity and more reproducible synthetic pathways. The target of avacincaptad pegol is complement C5—a key component of the terminal complement cascade. Complement C5 is critical because its activation leads to the generation of two potent effectors, C5a and C5b. Whereas C5a is a strong anaphylatoxin that triggers inflammatory responses, C5b initiates the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC), which can directly mediate cell lysis (Danzig et al., 2024). This candidate has emerged as a representative of a specialized class of complement inhibitors that are being explored for several inflammatory conditions, with the potential to prevent downstream tissue damage by modulating overactive immune pathways. Given the established importance of complement overactivation in dry AMD and GA, avacincaptad pegol’s molecular design makes it an attractive candidate for managing a disease state that has hitherto been largely untreatable (Tzoumas et al., 2023).

• Therapeutic History
The development of avacincaptad pegol is grounded in a longstanding recognition that dysregulated complement activation plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of dry AMD and associated geographic atrophy. Before the advent of targeted complement inhibitors, therapeutic strategies for GA were mostly limited to antioxidant supplementation and supportive measures, with few options capable of altering the disease trajectory. Early biochemical studies and genetic analyses demonstrated that variations in complement regulatory proteins, such as Factor H, are linked to increased susceptibility to AMD. This spurred a series of research initiatives aimed at modulating the complement cascade, ultimately resulting in the design of agents that can selectively inhibit critical components within the pathway (Dascalu et al., 2024).

Clinical evaluation of avacincaptad pegol began with Phase II trials such as NCT02686658, which investigated various dosing regimens in patients with non-foveal GA due to dry AMD. These studies revealed that intravitreal injections of Zimura were generally well tolerated in an elderly population and provided initial evidence for its efficacy by slowing the rate of GA lesion enlargement (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016). Building upon these early findings, subsequent pivotal studies—most notably the GATHER1 and GATHER2 Phase II/III trials—demonstrated that treatment with avacincaptad pegol led to statistically significant reductions in GA progression. The reduction in lesion growth, consistently observed in these studies, ranged between approximately 25% and 30% relative to sham-treated cohorts (Danzig et al., 2024; Cruz‐Pimentel & Wu, 2023). In addition, combination studies conducted in participants with neovascular AMD (such as those in NCT03362190 and NCT03364153) have helped to reinforce the concept that targeting the complement system may have broader applications in retinal disease (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2017; 2018). Together, these studies have solidified the scientific premise for using complement inhibition as a disease-modifying strategy in GA, ultimately resulting in regulatory approvals that now mark Zimura as one of the first approved agents for GA secondary to dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

• Mechanism of Action
At the molecular level, avacincaptad pegol has been engineered to bind with high specificity and affinity to complement component C5. Under normal physiological conditions, C5 is cleaved by the C5 convertase enzyme into two subunits: C5a, a potent inflammatory mediator, and C5b, which serves as the initiating fragment for the assembly of the membrane attack complex (MAC). The formation of MAC results in direct lysis of target cells and triggers additional inflammatory cascades. By preventing the cleavage of C5, avacincaptad pegol disrupts the production of C5a and the subsequent formation of MAC (Danzig et al., 2024).

One of the critical downstream consequences of blocking C5 cleavage is the mitigation of inflammasome activation in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells. The NLRP3 inflammasome is an innate immune complex that can be primed by C5a, leading to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the induction of pyroptosis or inflammatory cell death. In RPE cells, chronic exposure to a pro-inflammatory milieu—exacerbated by aberrant complement activity—can result in impaired phagocytic and autophagic processes. These processes are essential for the regular clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) and cellular debris, which is vital for maintaining retinal homeostasis (Borchert et al., 2023; Ewing et al., 2022).

In addition to halting the production of inflammatory mediators, selective inhibition of C5 by avacincaptad pegol also preserves upstream complement functions. Downstream inhibition of C5 allows the retention of activity in earlier components such as C3, which have beneficial roles in immune defense and tissue repair. This selective inhibition strategy offers an important advantage over broader complement inhibitors (for example, agents targeting C3) because it limits the risk of compromising protective immune functions while still effectively reducing harmful inflammation (Tzoumas et al., 2023).

On a biochemical level, the binding of the aptamer to C5 is mediated by a conformation-dependent interaction that prevents enzymatic cleavage by C5 convertase. Structural studies—though not extensively detailed in the available clinical trial excerpts—suggest that this binding is of high affinity and exhibits a long residence time, which underpins the sustained inhibition of the downstream inflammatory cascade over the dosing interval provided by monthly intravitreal injections (Danzig et al., 2024). Preclinical models have further demonstrated that by obstructing the cleavage of C5, there is a marked reduction in MAC deposition on the RPE and adjacent choroidal tissues, thereby protecting these cells from cytolytic injury and the resultant cascade of inflammatory events (Ewing et al., 2022).

• Expected Effect
Given the detailed mechanism of action, it is expected that avacincaptad pegol will produce several interrelated therapeutic effects in patients with dry AMD affected by GA. These expected outcomes are based on both anatomical and functional considerations.

First, the inhibition of C5 cleavage is anticipated to lead to a significant reduction in GA lesion growth. Clinical trials such as GATHER1 and GATHER2 have already provided evidence that monthly doses of avacincaptad pegol administered intravitreally slow the progression of GA lesion enlargement by approximately 25–30% relative to sham-treated controls (Danzig et al., 2024; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Quantitative imaging modalities, including fundus autofluorescence (FAF) and optical coherence tomography (OCT), have been used to assess lesion size and structural integrity. These imaging endpoints not only reflect the anatomical benefit of complement inhibition but are also correlated with the progression of visual functional decline, although improvements in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) may be modest due to the advanced nature of GA (Khanani et al., 2023).

Second, by reducing the levels of the inflammatory mediator C5a, avacincaptad pegol is expected to suppress the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in RPE cells. Inhibition of the inflammasome is crucial because its activation normally leads to the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18, which promote local retinal inflammation and contribute to pyroptosis—a form of inflammatory cell death. The reduction in inflammasome activity is hypothesized to lead to better preservation of RPE cell health, thereby maintaining their essential phagocytic and autophagic functions. In a healthy retina, these processes are critical for the daily clearance of POS and for preventing the accumulation of toxic metabolic debris. Experimental models and biochemical studies support the notion that complement-mediated inflammation is a key driver of impaired phagocytosis and autophagy in the RPE (Borchert et al., 2023; Antonio-Aguirre & Arevalo, 2023).

Third, by sparing upstream complement components, the use of avacincaptad pegol is expected to maintain the beneficial roles of C3 and other early complement proteins in immune surveillance and neuroprotection. This selective inhibition minimizes the risk of rendering the ocular microenvironment immunosuppressed—a significant consideration in a tissue that relies on precise immune regulation to counter infections and support repair processes (Tzoumas et al., 2023).

Fourth, the overall anticipated effect is not only a retardation in GA progression but also a potential slowing of visual function decline. Although the primary efficacy endpoints in clinical trials have largely focused on anatomical progression as measured by lesion size, the preservation of RPE function and reduction in inflammatory stress may indirectly contribute to maintaining photoreceptor health and visual acuity. Functional assays, including low-luminance visual acuity and BCVA tests, are expected to show stabilization or a slower rate of decline over prolonged treatment durations. While the improvements in visual function may be less immediately dramatic than the anatomical changes, they represent a clinically meaningful benefit in a disease state that otherwise progresses inexorably toward blindness (Ong et al., 2024).

In experimental assay systems—including in vitro analyses of RPE phagocytic activity and in vivo imaging of GA lesion progression—avacincaptad pegol should demonstrate clear evidence of complement inhibition. The reduction in markers of inflammation, improved cellular morphology of RPE, and slower expansion of retinal atrophy are the anticipated direct readouts. Collectively, these effects should translate into a net benefit for patients by delaying the progression of GA and potentially preserving residual visual function for a longer period (Qin et al., 2024).

• Overall Evaluation
Avacincaptad pegol emerges as a highly promising therapeutic candidate for dry AMD with geographic atrophy owing to its strong mechanistic rationale, targeted mode of action, and favorable clinical efficacy profiles demonstrated in multiple trials. Its design as a PEGylated RNA aptamer confers several advantages. First, its high specificity for complement C5 allows it to efficiently block the generation of C5a and the formation of the MAC. This selective inhibition is essential for reducing downstream inflammatory damage without broadly suppressing the entire complement cascade, thereby preserving the beneficial functions of early complement components (Danzig et al., 2024; Tzoumas et al., 2023).

The clinical history of Zimura is well supported by Phase II and III studies. Intravitreal injections of avacincaptad pegol have been shown to produce a robust reduction in GA lesion growth rates—effects that have been consistently noted across trials such as NCT02686658, GATHER1, and GATHER2. These studies have lent confidence to the potential for this agent to modify the course of a disease that previously had very few if any, therapeutic options. The reduction in lesion growth by approximately 25–30% clearly demonstrates an anatomical benefit that may have long-term implications for preserving vision, even if improvements in visual acuity are modest due to the advanced state of retinal degeneration in many patients (Khanani et al., 2023).

Mechanistically, the ability of avacincaptad pegol to mitigate inflammasome activation in the RPE is particularly compelling. Chronic activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome plays a critical role in driving the inflammatory milieu that impairs RPE function. By reducing the concentration of C5a, the therapeutic can suppress this inflammatory cascade and help restore efficient phagocytosis and autophagy. In doing so, it addresses two core pathological instigators in GA: inflammation-induced RPE cell death and the accumulation of cellular debris that further impairs retinal function (Borchert et al., 2023; Ewing et al., 2022). The translational impact of these mechanistic effects is supported by clinical endpoints showing that slower GA progression corresponds with a potential stabilization of visual function over time.

From a pharmacological perspective, the intravitreal route of administration furnishes multiple benefits. It circumvents the blood–retinal barrier, enabling high local drug concentrations that are critical for effective target engagement in the posterior segment of the eye. Moreover, the localized delivery minimizes systemic drug exposure, thereby reducing the likelihood of systemic side effects. However, it is important to note that intravitreal injections inherently come with a risk of injection-related complications such as endophthalmitis; yet, the clinical data indicate that avacincaptad pegol has a safety profile comparable to that of other intravitreal procedures, with the frequency of serious adverse ocular events remaining acceptably low (Ewing et al., 2022; Kang, 2023).

Despite these strengths, there are potential weaknesses and challenges that must be acknowledged. One of the key concerns noted in the literature is the potential for an increased risk of macular neovascularization (MNV) or conversion to exudative AMD over time. Although clinical studies report this risk as relatively low and manageable with currently available anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapies, it remains a potential safety signal that warrants continued observation in both clinical trial settings and post-marketing surveillance (Tzoumas et al., 2023). Furthermore, as with many therapies that specifically target one part of the complement cascade, long-term inhibition of C5 may have unforeseen effects on local immune regulation. Given that complement proteins are involved in both deleterious inflammatory processes and protective immune surveillance, a delicate balance must be maintained. The selective inhibition provided by avacincaptad pegol is designed to strike this balance by leaving upstream components intact, but the long-term consequences of chronic complement blockade in the eye will require further investigation (Dascalu et al., 2024).

Another area that merits further research is the direct demonstration of restored phagocytic and autophagic competence in RPE cells. Although preclinical studies and mechanistic insights suggest that complement inhibition should improve cellular clearance functions, robust longitudinal clinical data correlating improved RPE function with sustained visual outcomes are needed. Biomarkers that accurately reflect phagocytic and autophagic activity in vivo remain an area of active investigation. Overcoming this knowledge gap will be important for establishing that the reduction in GA lesion growth indeed translates into meaningful improvements in cellular viability and, ultimately, visual performance (Antonio-Aguirre & Arevalo, 2023; Qin et al., 2024).

When comparing avacincaptad pegol to other agents within the same therapeutic landscape, its distinct advantage lies in its selective targeting of complement C5. Other drugs, such as pegcetacoplan, target upstream components like C3 and may be associated with broader suppression of the complement system, which can lead to a higher risk of unwanted immunosuppressive effects. The focused action of Zimura not only yields efficacy in slowing GA progression but does so with a better-preserved overall immune function, which is of particular importance in the ocular setting (Tzoumas et al., 2023; Ong et al., 2024).

Overall, the evidence available from a range of biochemical, preclinical, and clinical studies supports the hypothesis that intravitreal avacincaptad pegol will effectively block the generation of C5a and MAC, thereby suppressing NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the RPE. In doing so, it is expected to restore phagocytic and autophagic competence by alleviating chronic sub-RPE inflammation and lysosomal dysfunction. The cumulative data suggest that this agent is well positioned to slow the progression of GA—a major unmet need in dry AMD—and offers a novel mechanism-based approach that addresses not only the inflammatory symptoms but also the underlying cellular dysfunction that drives disease progression.

In summary, avacincaptad pegol’s aptamer-based design, high specificity for complement C5, and demonstrated clinical efficacy in reducing GA lesion progression make it a compelling therapeutic candidate for dry AMD. Its intravitreal administration ensures effective local drug delivery while minimizing systemic exposure. Although certain concerns remain—such as potential neovascular conversion and the need for further demonstration of restored RPE clearance functions—the balance of evidence strongly supports continued development and deployment of this therapeutic. With positive Phase II/III clinical trial outcomes and regulatory approvals already in place, avacincaptad pegol represents a major milestone in the management of geographic atrophy secondary to dry AMD, offering hope for a disease that has long been resistant to effective treatment (Khanani et al., 2023; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

As we move forward, ongoing and future studies should focus on longer-term safety data and functional outcome measures as well as identifying biomarkers that can provide real-time feedback on RPE cellular health. This will help ensure that the anatomical benefits observed translate into sustained improvements in visual function and quality of life for patients suffering from this degenerative disease. In light of the current evidence, avacincaptad pegol positions itself as a pioneering candidate in a new paradigm of ocular therapeutics that targets the underlying mechanisms of complement-mediated inflammation and cellular dysfunction in dry AMD (Ong et al., 2024; Tzoumas et al., 2023).

• Conclusion
In conclusion, a comprehensive review of the biomedical, clinical, and biochemical literature indicates that avacincaptad pegol (Zimura) holds considerable potential as a treatment for dry age-related macular degeneration characterized by geographic atrophy. The agent’s design as a PEGylated RNA aptamer selectively targeting complement C5 enables it to block the generation of pro-inflammatory mediators, suppress inflammasome activation in the retinal pigment epithelium, and, importantly, preserve essential cellular processes such as phagocytosis and autophagy. These combined effects are anticipated to slow anatomical GA progression and potentially stabilize visual function. While questions remain regarding the long-term effects, particularly the risk of neovascular complications and the precise degree of functional recovery, the strengths of avacincaptad pegol—namely its high specificity, clinical efficacy evidenced by robust reductions in GA lesion growth, and acceptable safety profile—underscore its promise as a disease-modifying therapy in a field that has until recently lacked effective interventions. Continued research, long-term studies, and post-marketing surveillance will be vital to refining its risk–benefit profile and confirming its role in the management of dry AMD. Given the current evidence from preclinical models, Phase II/III clinical trials, and regulatory approvals, the development of avacincaptad pegol represents a significant and encouraging advance in ocular therapeutics with the potential to meaningfully alter the course of a debilitating disease (Danzig et al., 2024; Qin et al., 2024).

Overall, avacincaptad pegol is a highly promising candidate for repurposing as a therapeutic for dry AMD. Its mechanism of blocking C5 not only reduces the deleterious downstream effects of complement overactivation—including the generation of C5a and MAC formation—but also supports the restoration of crucial cellular processes in the RPE. These attributes, combined with the positive clinical data demonstrating slowed GA progression and a manageable safety profile, strongly support the continued investment in and development of this agent for a patient population with substantial unmet needs.
