Proposal for Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN; Cayman Chemical Cat# 39762)

Below is a comprehensive evaluation of Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN) as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD).

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) is an endogenous nucleotide derived from vitamin B3 that functions as an intermediate in the biosynthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). NMN is synthesized either naturally in cells through the salvage pathway—via the rate‐limiting conversion of nicotinamide to NMN by nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT)—or by chemical synthesis for research and clinical application; commercially available NMN (for example, Cayman Chemical Cat# 39762) is produced using high‐purity chemical synthesis methods. As a member of the NAD+ precursor class, NMN has been extensively studied as a potential “anti‐aging” molecule because of its capacity to restore reduced NAD+ pools in aged tissues. This class of compounds has been used in numerous preclinical studies addressing metabolic decline, neurodegeneration, cardiovascular aging, and more recently, ocular aging. The structural and functional characteristics of NMN enable it to cross cellular membranes—some studies even demonstrating its ability to cross the blood–retina barrier in rodents—thereby reaching retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells where NAD+ depletion is a hallmark of aging and AMD pathogenesis (Buonfiglio et al., 2024; Nalin, 2020).

Therapeutic History:
NMN has a robust preclinical history as a NAD+ booster in various animal models of aging and metabolic dysfunction. In the context of ophthalmology, several studies have evidenced that declining NAD+ levels in RPE cells correlate with mitochondrial dysfunction, increased oxidative stress, and ultimately cellular senescence—all vital pathological events in dry AMD. For example, studies using the ARPE-19 cell line and primary RPE cultures have demonstrated that inhibition of NAMPT (which leads to NAD+ depletion) results in increased senescence markers and mitochondrial impairments that can be rescued by NMN supplementation (Jadeja et al., 2018; Will, 2020). NMN has also been shown to improve mitochondrial bioenergetics and restore RPE-specific gene expression, supporting the notion that it counteracts the metabolic dysregulation associated with AMD (Will, 2020). In addition, in vivo rodent models indicate that systemic NMN administration restores retinal NAD+ levels, abrogates inflammatory responses, and preserves cellular integrity in degenerative conditions (Ren et al., 2022). Although NMN has not yet been tested directly in patients with dry AMD, preliminary human pharmacokinetic studies (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.) indicate that NMN is well tolerated in healthy adults and effectively increases systemic NAD+ levels. Thus, the therapeutic history of NMN—extending from preclinical models of retinal degeneration and metabolic disorders to early clinical trials—supports its potential for repurposing towards dry AMD, a disease that shares many of the underlying metabolic deficiencies observed in other age-related conditions (Buonfiglio et al., 2024; Jadeja et al., 2018; Ren et al., 2022).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, NMN exerts its therapeutic effects primarily by serving as a direct precursor for NAD+ biosynthesis in cells. Once inside the cell, NMN is converted to NAD+ through the action of NMN adenylyltransferases (NMNATs). Increased NAD+ levels subsequently activate a host of NAD+-dependent enzymes, most notably the sirtuin family deacetylases (with SIRT1 being of prime importance in the aging retina) (Jadeja et al., 2020; Will, 2020). SIRT1, a NAD+-dependent deacetylase, exerts protective effects by deacetylating and thereby activating the transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α). This activation leads to enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, improved oxidative phosphorylation, and the upregulation of antioxidant defense mechanisms that collectively reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation (Buonfiglio et al., 2024; Tong et al., 2022).
In addition to modulating mitochondrial function, increased NAD+ levels may stimulate autophagy–lysosome flux—a critical cellular recycling process that removes damaged mitochondria and misfolded proteins. Improved autophagy is particularly relevant for RPE cells, which are responsible for the daily clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) through Mer tyrosine kinase (MerTK)-dependent phagocytosis. Although direct evidence of NMN’s effects on MerTK-dependent phagocytosis is not abundantly detailed in the existing literature, several studies suggest that by restoring NAD+ and thereby improving mitochondrial function and reducing oxidative damage, NMN indirectly supports the cellular processes required for efficient POS clearance (Jadeja et al., 2018; Ren et al., 2022). Furthermore, NMN supplementation has been associated with reductions in cellular senescence markers, decreased DNA damage, and improved barrier functions in RPE models, all of which are consistent with a shift toward more youthful, resilient cellular metabolism (Will, 2020; Cimaglia, 2023). In summary, NMN’s mechanism of action involves replenishing intracellular NAD+ reserves, thereby enhancing SIRT1 activation, stimulating PGC-1α-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis, reducing mitochondrial oxidative stress, and fostering autophagy—a multi-pronged biochemical approach that directly addresses the cellular pathologies observed in dry AMD (Ren et al., 2022; Jadeja et al., 2020).

Expected Effect:
Based on its molecular mechanism, supplementation with NMN is expected to restore NAD+ levels in aged or stressed RPE cells, where NAD+ depletion is a common feature of dry AMD pathology. Restored NAD+ levels would likely lead to enhanced SIRT1 activity, which, through deacetylation of PGC-1α, promotes mitochondrial biogenesis and improves the overall mitochondrial function of RPE cells. This enhancement in mitochondrial bioenergetics is anticipated to result in increased ATP production and reduced levels of mitochondrial ROS, thereby ameliorating oxidative stress—a key contributor to RPE degeneration in dry AMD (Buonfiglio et al., 2024; Tong et al., 2022). In addition, the activation of the SIRT1/PGC-1α pathway is predicted to stimulate autophagy–lysosome flux, leading to more efficient removal of damaged cellular components and the restoration of normal cellular homeostasis. Such improvements in autophagic function could also enhance MerTK-dependent phagocytosis—the mechanism by which RPE cells routinely clear POS—with potential downstream benefits for retinal structure and function (Will, 2020; Jadeja et al., 2018). Furthermore, preclinical data indicate that NMN treatment reduces markers of cellular senescence and DNA damage in RPE cells, suggesting that NMN can protect against the pro-degenerative changes induced by oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction (Ren et al., 2022). Ultimately, the use of NMN is expected to re-establish a more youthful metabolic state in RPE cells, thereby slowing or even reversing some of the cellular declines that drive dry AMD progression (Buonfiglio et al., 2024; Will, 2020).

Overall Evaluation:
NMN presents a highly promising therapeutic candidate for dry AMD on several fronts. One of its primary strengths lies in its mechanistic specificity: by directly replenishing NAD+ levels, NMN targets a central metabolic deficiency in aging RPE cells. The activation of NAD+-dependent SIRT1, along with the subsequent stimulation of PGC-1α-driven mitochondrial biogenesis, addresses the fundamental issues of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress that are hallmarks of dry AMD (Buonfiglio et al., 2024; Tong et al., 2022). Preclinical models using ARPE-19 cells and primary RPE cultures have shown that NMN supplementation not only restores NAD+ but also rescues RPE-specific gene expression, mitigates cellular senescence, and improves mitochondrial function and cellular metabolism (Jadeja et al., 2018; Will, 2020). Furthermore, animal studies have demonstrated that NMN can cross the blood–retina barrier, which is crucial for any compound intended to exert direct effects on retinal cells (Ren et al., 2022).

Another considerable strength of NMN is its multi-targeted approach. In addition to enhancing mitochondrial bioenergetics, NMN is anticipated to boost autophagic processes that are integral to maintaining RPE cell homeostasis by facilitating the clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) via MerTK-dependent phagocytosis. Although direct evidence linking NMN to improved MerTK function remains somewhat indirect, the overall improvement in mitochondrial and autophagic function observed with NAD+ restoration (as seen in broader studies of NAD+ precursors) strongly supports the hypothesis that NMN could reverse the defective clearance seen in dry AMD (Ren et al., 2022; Will, 2020). Moreover, preliminary clinical data in healthy subjects have shown that NMN is well tolerated and capable of increasing systemic NAD+ levels—a key requisite before advancing to patient trials in dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

There are, however, several challenges and weaknesses that merit consideration. First, while the preclinical evidence is strong, direct clinical evidence of NMN’s efficacy in dry AMD expressly is currently lacking. Most data derivations stem from in vitro studies and animal models that, despite their relevance, may not fully capture the complex pathology of AMD in human patients (Jadeja et al., 2018; Ren et al., 2022). Second, some of the supporting studies appear in journals with varied reputations, indicating that further rigorous, randomized clinical trials specifically targeting dry AMD endpoints are needed. In addition, while NMN has clear effects on NAD+ restoration and SIRT1 activation, direct documentation of its influence on MerTK-dependent phagocytosis is currently inferred rather than explicitly demonstrated; additional mechanistic studies should investigate whether and how NMN improves the phagocytic clearance of POS by RPE cells (Will, 2020; Zhang et al., 2024).

In conclusion, NMN’s ability to restore NAD+ levels, enhance SIRT1/PGC-1α signaling, improve mitochondrial function, reduce ROS levels, and potentially promote autophagy and phagocytic clearance makes it a highly attractive candidate for repurposing in dry AMD therapy. Its mechanistic rationale is well supported by a substantial body of preclinical research, and its favorable safety profile in early human studies further bolsters its translational potential. Despite the need for more direct clinical and mechanistic studies in the context of dry AMD, NMN stands out as a promising candidate that could address several key pathological processes underlying RPE degeneration. Given these strengths and the well-defined hypothesis that links NAD+ restoration with improved mitochondrial and autophagic function in RPE cells, advancing NMN into further preclinical and clinical investigations for dry AMD would be a strategically sound decision for the drug development team (Buonfiglio et al., 2024; Ren et al., 2022; Will, 2020; Cimaglia, 2023).

Overall, the candidate NMN offers a multifaceted and mechanistically rational approach to combat dry AMD by directly targeting NAD+ depletion—a central driver of RPE dysfunction—and thereby restoring the cellular processes necessary for retinal homeostasis and longevity.
