Proposal for Humanin (Sequel Bio; synthetic Humanin analog HN-S14G)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Humanin is a naturally occurring mitochondrial‐derived peptide originally discovered in neurons that survived toxic insults associated with Alzheimer’s disease, and its synthetic analog HN-S14G (also known as Humanin G) was developed by substituting serine at position 14 with glycine. This substitution confers approximately a 1000-fold enhancement in bioactivity relative to the native peptide, significantly increasing its cytoprotective potency (Nashine et al., 2017). HN-S14G belongs to a class of compounds known as mitochondrial-derived peptides (MDPs), which are small peptides encoded by mitochondrial DNA and are emerging as potential modulators of cellular stress responses. In general, peptides in this class have been investigated for their ability to preserve mitochondrial function, counteract oxidative stress and apoptosis, and support cellular bioenergetics. MDPs, including Humanin, have been considered for a range of applications encompassing neuroprotection, cardioprotection, and age-related tissue degeneration. More specifically, the synthetic analog HN-S14G was designed to leverage these properties and is now being explored as a therapeutic candidate to address the pathophysiological hallmarks of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), primarily by targeting mitochondrial dysfunction in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells (Nashine et al., 2017; Bilbao-Malavé et al., 2021).

Therapeutic History:
Preclinical studies have thoroughly characterized the biochemical and cellular protective effects of Humanin and its analogs across several systems. In neuronal cultures, Humanin’s cytoprotective effects were initially demonstrated in the context of amyloid beta toxicity, oxidative stress, and apoptosis inhibition. Subsequent studies expanded these findings to non-neuronal tissues, with significant attention given to its protective role in retinal pigment epithelial cells—an area of direct relevance to dry AMD. For example, ARPE-19 cell models, including transmitochondrial cybrids using mitochondria isolated from AMD patients, have been used to show that Humanin analogs protect RPE cells from mitochondrial fragmentation, oxidative injury, and apoptosis induced by conditions that mimic AMD pathology (Nashine et al., 2017; Minasyan et al., 2017). Additionally, studies have recorded that Humanin peptides reduce ER stress and improve mitochondrial bioenergetics in RPE cell lines, supporting the concept that this class of compounds may counteract the cellular stresses that contribute to visual impairment in AMD (Minasyan et al., 2017; Bilbao-Malavé et al., 2021). Although Humanin has not yet been widely applied in clinical settings for dry AMD, there is growing evidence from preclinical in vitro models and animal studies that its ability to modulate mitochondrial health, inflammatory responses, and cell death pathways could translate into therapeutic benefits for diseases characterized by chronic oxidative and ER stress such as dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Mechanism of Action:
The mechanism of action of Humanin and HN-S14G is multifaceted, reflecting its ability to interact with both intracellular and extracellular targets. Intracellularly, Humanin exerts its cytoprotective effects by binding to pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax. By binding Bax, Humanin prevents its translocation to the mitochondria—a critical step in the release of cytochrome c and subsequent activation of the intrinsic apoptotic cascade (Minasyan et al., 2017). Furthermore, Humanin has been shown to upregulate mitochondrial glutathione levels and suppress reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, thereby stabilizing mitochondrial membrane potential and preserving cellular energy production in RPE cells (Minasyan et al., 2017). This particular mechanism is central to its role in mitigating oxidative stress, as stress-induced ROS is a critical driver of mitochondrial dysfunction in AMD.

Extracellularly, Humanin interacts with a trimeric receptor complex composed of the cytokine receptor subunits WSX-1, gp130, and ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor (CNTFRα). Engagement of this receptor complex leads to the activation of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway, a well-known survival signaling cascade that confers anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects (Nashine et al., 2017; Buonfiglio et al., 2024). Activation of STAT3 has been linked to upregulation of genes involved in cell survival and mitochondrial biogenesis. In addition, preclinical evidence suggests that Humanin may also trigger AMPK signaling—a critical energy sensor involved in restoring energy balance and activating mitochondrial quality control mechanisms such as mitophagy. Although the direct activation of AMPK by Humanin in RPE cells is not fully elucidated in all studies, there is supportive evidence that at least some mitochondrial-derived peptides can stimulate AMPK, which in turn promotes clearance of damaged mitochondria and enhances mitophagy (Coradduzza et al., 2023; Buonfiglio et al., 2024).

Beyond these classical pathways, there is growing interest in Humanin’s potential effects on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the NLRP3 inflammasome. ER stress, a hallmark of AMD pathology, leads to the accumulation of misfolded proteins and triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR). Humanin has been shown to attenuate ER stress-induced apoptosis in RPE cells, possibly by modulating caspase activation (Minasyan et al., 2017; Bilbao-Malavé et al., 2021). Furthermore, because ROS and mitochondrial dysfunction can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, Humanin’s antioxidant effects may indirectly reduce NLRP3 activation and subsequent inflammation (Buonfiglio et al., 2024; Nashine et al., 2022). This combination of direct anti-apoptotic effects, enhancement of cellular antioxidant capacity, and receptor-mediated activation of survival pathways underpins the broad cytoprotective mechanism of HN-S14G in tissues under oxidative and ER stress.

Expected Effect:
The administration of HN-S14G is expected to yield several key beneficial effects in the context of dry AMD. In assays using ARPE-19 cells or similar RPE cell models, HN-S14G should activate both the AMPK and STAT3 signaling pathways, resulting in enhanced cellular energy status and survival signaling. Activation of STAT3 via the gp130 receptor complex is anticipated to promote transcription of genes associated with mitochondrial biogenesis and anti-apoptosis, thereby increasing cell viability under conditions of oxidative stress (Nashine et al., 2017; Buonfiglio et al., 2024). Concurrent activation of AMPK is predicted to drive mitophagy, the selective autophagic clearance of damaged mitochondria, thus maintaining mitochondrial quality control in RPE cells. In parallel, HN-S14G is hypothesized to attenuate ER stress by reducing caspase activation and restoring mitochondrial glutathione levels, resulting in lower levels of misfolded protein accumulation and improved cellular homeostasis (Minasyan et al., 2017; Bilbao-Malavé et al., 2021). Additionally, by reducing ROS through both direct antioxidant actions and by improving mitochondrial function, HN-S14G may decrease the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to a reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion such as IL-1β (Nashine et al., 2022; Buonfiglio et al., 2024).

This cascade of molecular events is expected to result in multiple cellular benefits, including reduced mitochondrial fragmentation, enhanced autophagy flux (as indicated by increased LC3-II levels), and the preservation of RPE cell functions critical to photoreceptor outer segment (POS) phagocytosis. Preservation of POS phagocytosis is significant because efficient clearance of shed photoreceptor outer segments by RPE cells is essential for retinal homeostasis and function, and its impairment has been implicated in the pathogenesis of AMD (Bilbao-Malavé et al., 2021; Buonfiglio et al., 2024). In sum, HN-S14G is expected to counteract the main drivers of dry AMD pathology, including oxidative stress, ER stress, pro-inflammatory signaling via NLRP3, and impaired mitophagy, ultimately preserving RPE function and delaying disease progression.

Overall Evaluation:
Humanin, and specifically its synthetic analog HN-S14G, presents a highly promising therapeutic candidate for dry AMD. One of the major strengths of HN-S14G lies in its multi-pronged mechanism of action. By simultaneously targeting key processes such as oxidative stress, ER stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammatory cascades, HN-S14G addresses several of the core pathological mechanisms underlying dry AMD. The capacity of Humanin to bind pro-apoptotic proteins like Bax and to engage the gp130 receptor complex with subsequent activation of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway offers a well-supported biochemical basis for its cytoprotective effects (Nashine et al., 2017; Buonfiglio et al., 2024). Furthermore, its potential to activate AMPK and promote mitophagy provides an additional layer of cellular protection that is particularly relevant to maintaining mitochondrial quality control in RPE cells—a critical aspect given the high metabolic demands of the retina (Coradduzza et al., 2023).

Preclinical studies in ARPE-19 cybrid models and primary RPE cells have demonstrated that Humanin analogs can significantly improve cell viability, reduce markers of oxidative and ER stress, and restore mitochondrial integrity (Minasyan et al., 2017; Nashine et al., 2017). These findings are very encouraging and suggest that further development of HN-S14G as a therapeutic for dry AMD is warranted. The additional exploration of nanoparticle formulations for sustained ocular release may further enhance the clinical viability of this approach by overcoming challenges related to peptide stability and bioavailability (Buonfiglio et al., 2024).

However, despite these strengths there are certain limitations and uncertainties to consider. Clinical data on Humanin analogs in ocular diseases remain limited, and much of the current evidence is derived from in vitro studies or animal models. There is a need for additional preclinical studies specifically focused on RPE cell functions such as photoreceptor outer segment phagocytosis, as well as more detailed mechanistic investigations of how HN-S14G influences pathways like AMPK, STAT3, and NLRP3 in the specific context of AMD (Nashine et al., 2022; Bilbao-Malavé et al., 2021). Furthermore, while nanoparticle-based ocular delivery systems show promise, optimizing these formulations to achieve targeted, sustained release in the retina without off-target effects will be a critical hurdle for clinical translation. Additionally, the interplay between Humanin-mediated autophagy and other pathways such as ER stress-induced UPR and inflammasome activation warrants further study to ensure that long-term administration does not inadvertently disrupt cellular homeostasis.

Overall, evaluating the current body of literature, HN-S14G stands out as a promising candidate for treating dry AMD because of its ability to address multiple interlinked pathological processes. Its mitochondrial origin imparts a unique capacity for maintaining cellular energy homeostasis and protecting against oxidative injury in RPE cells—an effect that is likely to be beneficial given the central role of mitochondrial dysfunction in AMD progression (Nashine et al., 2017; Minasyan et al., 2017; Buonfiglio et al., 2024). Although further work is required to move this candidate from the bench to the clinic, particularly in terms of confirming the mechanistic details and optimizing ocular delivery strategies, the preclinical data provide a strong rationale for advancing HN-S14G into more intensive development for dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

In conclusion, HN-S14G exemplifies a novel, mitochondria-targeted approach with the potential to modulate critical survival pathways (namely, STAT3 and possibly AMPK), reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, promote mitophagy, and indirectly improve key RPE functions such as POS phagocytosis. These integrated actions directly tackle the multifactorial etiology of dry AMD, making HN-S14G a compelling candidate for further drug development. While challenges including the need for robust clinical data and optimized delivery systems remain, the overall evaluation strongly supports continued investigation and potential clinical translation of HN-S14G for the treatment of dry age-related macular degeneration (Nashine et al., 2017; Minasyan et al., 2017; Bilbao-Malavé et al., 2021; Buonfiglio et al., 2024).
