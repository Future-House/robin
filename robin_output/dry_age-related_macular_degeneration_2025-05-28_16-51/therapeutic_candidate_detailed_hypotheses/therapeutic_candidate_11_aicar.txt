Proposal for AICAR (5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
AICAR (5‐Aminoimidazole‐4‐carboxamide ribonucleotide) is a synthetic nucleotide analog originally discovered as an intermediate in purine biosynthesis that has been repurposed as a pharmacological activator of AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK) (Theodoropoulou et al., 2013). As a nucleoside analog, AICAR is taken up into cells via adenosine transporters and subsequently phosphorylated by adenosine kinase into ZMP, an analog of AMP. This conversion mimics a high intracellular AMP/ATP ratio—a signal of energy stress—thereby activating AMPK (Al‐Moujahed et al., 2014). Compounds belonging to this class have historically been used as metabolic modulators in studies of cellular energy homeostasis, as well as in preclinical oncology and inflammatory disease models, positioning them as valuable tools for probing metabolic pathways across a range of diseases. In essence, AICAR belongs to a class of compounds that modulate cellular metabolism through direct engagement of AMPK, and its synthesis and biochemical processing make it representative of nontraditional therapeutics that repurpose metabolic stress signals for therapeutic gain (Theodoropoulou et al., 2013).

Therapeutic History:
AICAR has been widely used in preclinical studies to investigate its anti‐proliferative, anti‐inflammatory, and metabolic regulatory effects. In oncology research, AICAR has been administered to inhibit cell growth in various cancer cell lines, including retinoblastoma and uveal melanoma (Theodoropoulou et al., 2010; Al‐Moujahed et al., 2014). In the context of ocular diseases, studies have demonstrated its capacity to suppress inflammatory cytokine production in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells and reduce complement activation (Chung et al., 2017). Beyond oncology and inflammation, AICAR has been explored in models of metabolic dysfunction and retinal degeneration since AMPK activation is known to enhance mitochondrial biogenesis and modulate autophagy, both processes critically involved in retinal health (Zhang et al., 2020). Although AICAR itself has not been tested extensively in clinical trials specifically for dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD), its use as an experimental probe in diverse retinal models—including diabetic retinopathy, endotoxin‐induced uveitis, and mitochondrial dysfunction in iPSC‐derived RPE cells—provides a foundation for hypothesizing its utility in dry AMD (Ebeling et al., 2022; Chan et al., 2020). In addition, clinical observations in conditions linked to inflammatory and metabolic dysregulation—such as the obesity‐related clinical trial that evaluated AMPK activators including AICAR in ex vivo human adipose macrophage assays (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.)—underscore its potential wider therapeutic applicability. In summary, although AICAR’s clinical use has been predominantly investigational and confined to preclinical models of various diseases, its robust record as an activator of AMPK in ocular and systemic models creates a compelling rationale for further investigation in dry AMD.

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, AICAR functions by entering the cell through nucleoside transporters and undergoing phosphorylation by adenosine kinase to form ZMP, a direct mimetic of AMP (Al‐Moujahed et al., 2014; Theodoropoulou et al., 2013). This accumulation of ZMP results in the activation of the AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK) complex, a heterotrimeric serine/threonine kinase that comprises a catalytic α subunit along with regulatory β and γ subunits (Kumar et al., 2016). Once activated, AMPK orchestrates a wide range of cellular responses that restore energy balance. Key among these is the inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway through phosphorylation of downstream targets such as TSC2 and Raptor, ultimately leading to decreased phosphorylation of mTOR effectors including 4E‐BP1 and ribosomal protein S6 (Al‐Moujahed et al., 2014; Matoba et al., 2017). Inhibition of mTORC1 is closely coupled with the induction of autophagy, as suppression of mTOR removes a well‐established blockade on autophagosomal formation. This interplay between AMPK and mTOR is critical in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), a cell type that is notoriously vulnerable to both oxidative stress and the cumulative burden of waste products such as photoreceptor outer segments (POS) (Chung et al., 2017; Ebeling et al., 2022). Moreover, AMPK activation by AICAR leads to reduced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and suppression of inflammatory signaling pathways, including inhibition of NF‐κB and MAPK cascades, which are implicated in retinal inflammatory processes (Kamoshita et al., 2014; Chung et al., 2017). In retinal models, these actions not only preserve cell viability by enhancing autophagic clearance but also improve barrier function and metabolic homeostasis (Ebeling et al., 2022). In sum, the known mechanism of action of AICAR entails its intracellular conversion to ZMP, subsequent activation of AMPK, inhibition of the mTOR pathway, and stimulation of autophagy—all of which are molecular events that are favorable for mitigating the metabolic stress and inflammatory burden seen in dry AMD.

Expected Effect:
Based on the mechanistic insights and supporting preclinical studies, the hypothesis posits that in RPE cells, AICAR will stimulate AMPK activation leading to the inhibition of mTORC1, thereby inducing autophagy‐mediated clearance of harmful cellular aggregates such as photoreceptor outer segments (POS). Studies in ARPE‐19 cells—an established in vitro model for RPE function—have demonstrated that under stress conditions mimicking AMD pathology, treatment with AICAR (at a concentration of 1 mM) increases levels of the autophagosome marker LC3‐II by approximately 2.5-fold (Chung et al., 2017). This upregulation of LC3‐II is indicative of enhanced autophagy, which is critical for degrading and recycling damaged cellular components. Concurrent with the increase in autophagy markers, AICAR treatment was observed to restore lysosomal pH homeostasis and improve the phagocytic uptake of fluorescently labeled photoreceptor outer segments (FITC‐POS), with an enhancement reported to be around 42 % (Ebeling et al., 2022). In primary human RPE cells, similar effects were found, including improved barrier function and reduced ROS generation (Chung et al., 2017; Ebeling et al., 2022). Because autophagy and lysosomal degradation are fundamental to maintaining RPE cell health in the face of constant POS phagocytosis, this mechanism is particularly relevant to dry AMD, whose pathogenesis involves both impaired autophagic clearance and subsequent cellular stress. Importantly, the expression of AMPK in RPE cells has been well‐documented, and its activation correlates with enhanced mitochondrial function and reduced inflammatory markers (Zhang et al., 2020; Ebeling et al., 2022). Hence, the expected effect of AICAR in the proposed assay is multifold: stimulation of AMPK will lead to mTOR inhibition and consequent autophagosome formation, restoration of lysosomal acidification, enhanced degradation of photoreceptor debris, and overall improved cellular resilience and function. The cumulative result of these actions is anticipated to reduce the pathological accumulation of waste products in dry AMD and maintain or restore the integrity of the RPE layer.

Overall Evaluation:
The repurposing of AICAR for dry AMD presents several compelling strengths as well as notable challenges. On the strength side, AICAR offers clear mechanistic target engagement; its capacity to activate AMPK and simultaneously inhibit mTOR has been demonstrated in multiple ocular cell models (Chung et al., 2017; Al‐Moujahed et al., 2014). This dual action is highly relevant to the pathophysiology of dry AMD, where impaired autophagy and chronic oxidative stress contribute to RPE dysfunction. Preclinical data in ARPE‐19 cells stressed with A2E, a toxic bisretinoid that accumulates in RPE cells and is implicated in AMD, indicate that AICAR treatment significantly increases autophagy markers and improves functional endpoints like phagocytosis and lysosomal pH restoration (Ebeling et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2017). Moreover, primary human RPE assays corroborate these findings by showing improved barrier function and reduced reactive oxygen species generation after AICAR treatment (Chung et al., 2017).

However, several challenges and weaknesses must be considered. First, while the in vitro and ex vivo data in RPE models are promising, there remains a paucity of direct preclinical in vivo evidence specific to dry AMD. For example, most of the studies cited focus on inflammatory models, retinal tumors, or general mitochondrial dysfunction, rather than on chronic degenerative models that recapitulate the full complexity of dry AMD pathology (Zhang et al., 2020; Chan et al., 2020). Second, the clinical use of AICAR is currently limited, and its pharmacokinetic profile, bioavailability, and potential systemic side effects require thorough characterization before it can be safely applied in an ocular setting. Although some studies have reported low toxicity in animal models at relatively high doses (Al‐Moujahed et al., 2014), translation to human patients, particularly in a chronic disease like AMD, may necessitate significant optimization or the development of analogs with improved ocular specificity. Third, the complexity of the AMPK/mTOR/autophagy axis implies that responses to AICAR may be highly context‐dependent. For instance, metformin—another AMPK activator—has shown paradoxical effects in retinal cells by exacerbating mitochondrial dysfunction under certain stress conditions (Chan et al., 2020). This underscores the need for caution in selecting the appropriate dosing regimen and administration route. Fourth, while the evidence supports improved autophagy markers, enhanced LC3‐II conversion, and restoration of lysosomal pH in cell culture, the exact dynamics of photoreceptor outer segment clearance in vivo, and how these effects translate to meaningful clinical benefit in dry AMD patients, remain to be fully demonstrated. Finally, the potential for compensatory feedback mechanisms in chronic disease states may diminish the long‐term efficacy of AICAR if such feedback is not concurrently modulated.

In conclusion, AICAR is a promising candidate for repurposing as a therapeutic agent for dry AMD based on its well‐documented mode of action as an AMPK activator, its capacity to inhibit mTOR signaling, and its ability to stimulate autophagy—mechanisms that are directly relevant to the pathogenesis of dry AMD (Chung et al., 2017; Ebeling et al., 2022; Kim et al., 2021). The preclinical evidence—particularly improved autophagosome formation, restoration of lysosomal pH, enhanced phagocytosis of POS, and reduction in oxidative stress in RPE cells—provides a strong mechanistic rationale for further development of AICAR or optimized analogs (Ebeling et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2017). Nevertheless, the transition from mechanistic probe to clinically viable therapeutic will require rigorous exploration of its pharmacodynamics in ocular tissues, careful dose optimization to minimize potential systemic adverse effects, and validation in relevant in vivo models that recapitulate the chronic degenerative aspects of dry AMD (Zhang et al., 2020; Chan et al., 2020). Overall, while limitations exist—most notably the lack of direct in vivo data in dry AMD models and potential safety concerns—the strong preclinical mechanistic and functional data support the pursuit of AICAR as a valuable candidate for further investigation in dry AMD drug development.
