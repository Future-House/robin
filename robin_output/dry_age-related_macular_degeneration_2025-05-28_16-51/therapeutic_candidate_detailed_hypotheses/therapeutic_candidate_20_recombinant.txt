Proposal for Recombinant human Gas6 (R&D Systems Cat# 885-GS-050)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Recombinant human Gas6 is a biologically derived protein produced via recombinant expression systems – typically in mammalian cells – to generate a protein that is structurally and functionally identical to its native counterpart. Gas6, also known as growth arrest‐specific gene 6, belongs to the vitamin K‐dependent protein family and features an N‐terminal Gla domain that is critical for binding to phosphatidylserine on apoptotic or activated cell surfaces (Wu et al., 2017, pp. 2–3). As a recombinant therapeutic, it is classified as a biologic protein therapeutic and is supplied by vendors such as R&D Systems (Cat# 885-GS-050). This class of therapeutic compounds has been used extensively in research to study receptor–ligand interactions, particularly in the context of the TAM receptor family (Tyro3, Axl, and MerTK), where endogenous Gas6 functions as a high-affinity ligand. These proteins have been used in various experimental systems to elucidate signaling functions including immune regulation, cell survival, and phagocytosis (Burstyn-Cohen et al., 2012, pp. 1–2).

Therapeutic History:
Gas6 and its interaction with TAM receptors have been studied in multiple preclinical settings, predominantly in biochemical and genetic investigations. Genetic studies in mice have demonstrated that deletion of Gas6 – particularly in combination with Protein S deficiency – recapitulates the defective phagocytosis phenotypes observed with MerTK mutations, underscoring its importance in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) function (Burstyn-Cohen et al., 2012, pp. 14–17). Preclinical studies in retinal models have shown that Gas6 enhances phagocytic clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) by RPE cells, a process that is crucial for retinal homeostasis (Inana et al., 2018, pp. 11–12). Although recombinant Gas6 protein itself has been more thoroughly evaluated in in vitro and small animal models – with data demonstrating enhanced phagocytosis under stress conditions – there is as yet limited clinical trial or veterinary data using Gas6 for dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD). However, additional clinical research into the modulation of Gas6/TAM signaling exists in oncology – for example, an ovarian cancer trial focused on targeting Gas6 binding to its receptor Axl (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021) – which indirectly validates the importance of Gas6 in modulating receptor-mediated signaling. Thus, while Gas6 has not been directly repurposed in clinical studies for AMD, the extensive body of preclinical and genetic evidence supporting its role in RPE phagocytosis forms a strong rationale for its consideration as a therapeutic candidate for dry AMD (Ochoa et al., 2023).

Mechanism of Action:
The proposed mechanism of action for recombinant human Gas6 in dry AMD is rooted in its capacity to bind and activate MerTK on the apical surface of RPE cells. MerTK is a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays an essential role in mediating the daily phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments. Activation of MerTK by its ligand Gas6 triggers downstream signaling cascades that include focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and the small GTPase Rac1, both of which are critical regulators of cytoskeletal reorganization (Strick & Vollrath, 2010, pp. 1–2). Upon binding of Gas6 to MerTK, receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation occur, leading to the recruitment of intracellular adaptor proteins and the subsequent activation of FAK. This kinase activation initiates a cascade resulting in Rac1-mediated reorganization of actin filaments, thereby facilitating the extension of pseudopodia and engulfment of POS debris (Burstyn-Cohen et al., 2012, pp. 14–17). Biochemical studies have detailed how Gas6, through its vitamin K-dependent Gla domain, bridges phosphatidylserine on apoptotic POS to MerTK, essentially “tagging” the debris for phagocytosis (Wu et al., 2017, pp. 2–3). In addition, in vitro data in stressed induced pluripotent stem cell-derived RPE (iPSC-RPE) have demonstrated that treatment with recombinant Gas6 can boost POS ingestion by approximately two-fold, which supports the hypothesis that exogenous Gas6 can overcome the phagocytic deficits common under oxidative conditions found in dry AMD (Albert et al., 2015, pp. 1–2). Moreover, expression data confirm that MerTK is robustly expressed in RPE cells, establishing the requisite cellular context for Gas6 action (Burstyn-Cohen et al., 2012, pp. 1–2).

Expected Effect:
The expected effect of recombinant human Gas6 in the proposed dry AMD model is a restoration of deficient RPE phagocytic activity. Under oxidative stress conditions – which are characteristic of the aged retina in dry AMD – RPE phagocytosis is compromised, leading to an accumulation of photoreceptor debris, lipofuscin, and other toxic metabolic byproducts. Exogenously administered Gas6 is anticipated to bind to MerTK on the RPE surface, thereby activating the downstream FAK/Rac1 signaling cascade that reorganizes the cytoskeleton, enhances the formation of phagocytic cups, and promotes the internalization of POS (Wu et al., 2021, pp. 7–10). In vitro studies with stressed iPSC-RPE cells have shown that recombinant Gas6 boosts POS uptake by about two-fold, suggesting that, when delivered via periocular injection to ensure sufficient retinal exposure, recombinant Gas6 can ameliorate the phagocytic deficits that contribute to debris accumulation in dry AMD (Wu et al., 2021, pp. 2–7). The increased phagocytosis is expected to alleviate the chronic oxidative stress and inflammation that drive RPE dysfunction and photoreceptor death, potentially translating to stabilization of retinal structure and improved visual outcomes (Inana et al., 2018, p. 15).

Overall Evaluation:
Recombinant human Gas6 presents as a promising candidate for the treatment of dry AMD based on a strong mechanistic framework and extensive preclinical validation of its role in RPE phagocytosis. One major strength of Gas6 as a therapeutic is that it directly targets MerTK, a receptor with well-documented genetic validation in retinal dystrophies – evidenced by the fact that MerTK loss-of-function in RCS rats results in severe impairment of POS clearance (Strick & Vollrath, 2010, pp. 1–2; Burstyn-Cohen et al., 2012, pp. 14–17). This receptor-ligand interaction is highly specific, offering a mechanistic advantage over more generalized anti-inflammatory or neuroprotective strategies. Additionally, in vitro studies have demonstrated that recombinant Gas6 can double the phagocytic uptake of stressed RPE cells, which is highly encouraging given the central role of impaired phagocytosis in dry AMD pathology (Albert et al., 2015, pp. 1–2; Wu et al., 2021, pp. 2–7).

Another strength lies in the potential delivery strategy: periocular injections have been previously explored for other recombinant proteins targeting the retina, suggesting that achieving therapeutically relevant retinal levels of Gas6 is feasible (Wu et al., 2021, pp. 10–12). The specificity of Gas6 also means that, if appropriately dosed, it is likely to have fewer off-target effects, although caution is warranted given its known pro-angiogenic effects in other ocular cell types (Kim et al., 2014, pp. 8–10). Such effects could be problematic in wet AMD settings; however, in the context of dry AMD – where neovascularization is not a primary concern – these pro-angiogenic properties may be less problematic or may require careful modulation of dosing and timing.

Despite the promising attributes, there are some weaknesses that merit further investigation. First, while preclinical data supporting the role of Gas6 in enhancing RPE phagocytosis are robust, there is a significant gap in clinical data regarding its safety, tolerability, and efficacy in patients with dry AMD. Most of the current evidence comes from in vitro experiments and animal models, and extrapolation to human disease will require carefully designed clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2011; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2022). Second, as a recombinant protein, Gas6 may have a relatively short half-life in vivo and could require sustained delivery formulations – as has been attempted with nanoparticle encapsulation in preclinical models – to achieve continuous receptor activation (Wu et al., 2021, pp. 13–14). This introduces potential challenges related to formulation, dosing frequency, and cost of goods. Additionally, while Gas6 preferentially activates MerTK, it also binds to other TAM receptors such as Axl and Tyro3, which may lead to off-target effects that are not yet fully characterized in the retinal microenvironment (Lahey et al., 2022, pp. 3–4).

In summary, recombinant human Gas6 is a strong candidate for addressing a fundamental defect in dry AMD – the impaired phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments due to compromised MerTK signaling. The molecular rationale is well supported by genetic and biochemical data showing that Gas6 is a high-affinity ligand for MerTK and that its engagement initiates FAK/Rac1-mediated cytoskeletal remodeling to promote phagocytosis (Strick & Vollrath, 2010, pp. 1–2; Burstyn-Cohen et al., 2012, pp. 14–17; Wu et al., 2017, pp. 2–3). The expected benefits include a restoration of normal RPE function, reduction in debris accumulation, and potential stabilization of the degenerative process in dry AMD (Inana et al., 2018, pp. 11–12; Wu et al., 2021, pp. 7–10). However, the translational pathway will require addressing the challenges of rapid protein clearance, ensuring targeted retinal exposure via appropriate delivery methods, and minimizing possible off-target effects related to the pleiotropic actions of Gas6 (Ochoa et al., 2023; Lahey et al., 2022, pp. 1–3; Burstyn-Cohen et al., 2012, pp. 1–2).
