Proposal for VX-765 (Belnacasan)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
VX-765 (Belnacasan) is a small molecule prodrug originally developed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals that belongs to the peptidomimetic caspase inhibitor class. Chemically derived from a tetrapeptide sequence resembling the natural substrate of caspase-1, VX-765 is engineered to be orally bioavailable and is converted in vivo to its active metabolite VRT-043198. This active form covalently modifies the catalytic cysteine residue in the caspase-1 active site, thereby inhibiting its proteolytic function (Adriaenssens, 2017; Adamova, Kudelova, & Fleischmannova, 2015). Caspase-1 inhibitors like VX-765 have been of interest as modulators of inflammation since they prevent the cleavage and activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18). The broader class of caspase inhibitors has been used in various preclinical inflammatory and neurodegenerative conditions with the goal of reducing excessive cell death and dampening inflammatory cascades (Adamova et al., 2015; Li et al., 2022).

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic history of VX-765 and related caspase-1 inhibitors spans several inflammatory and autoimmune disease models. VX-765, in particular, has been evaluated in a variety of clinical settings including epilepsy, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and other systemic inflammatory diseases due to its potent inhibition of caspase-1 mediated cytokine activation (Dhani, Zhao, & Zhivotovsky, 2021; Adamova et al., 2015). Although early clinical trials indicated that VX-765 could reduce plasma levels of IL-1β and related downstream inflammatory markers, some clinical programs encountered challenges such as liver toxicity when used systemically in conditions like treatment-resistant partial epilepsy (Dhani et al., 2021; Adamova et al., 2015). Importantly, while its anti-inflammatory effects have been documented in various non-ocular disease models, there is as yet no direct clinical or preclinical evidence of VX-765 being employed specifically to treat dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) or similar retinal degenerative diseases. However, its mechanism of action—targeting caspase-1 to reduce IL-1β and IL-18 maturation—is mechanistically relevant to conditions such as dry AMD, where excessive activation of inflammatory pathways in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells contributes to disease pathology (Campbell & Doyle, 2013; Wooff et al., 2020).

Mechanism of Action:
VX-765 functions by targeting caspase-1, the protease responsible for the cleavage of the biologically inactive precursors pro–IL-1β and pro–IL-18 into their mature, pro-inflammatory forms. At the molecular level, VX-765 is metabolized to VRT-043198, which binds to the catalytic cysteine residue within the active site of caspase-1. This covalent modification effectively inactivates caspase-1, thereby inhibiting downstream effects such as the activation of the inflammasome complex and the induction of pyroptosis, an inflammatory form of programmed cell death (Li et al., 2022; Adamova et al., 2015). Structurally, the molecule is designed to mimic the peptide sequence that caspase-1 typically recognizes, allowing it to compete with natural substrates and block their cleavage (Adriaenssens, 2017). Caspase-1 plays a central role in inflammasome signaling, a pathway that has been extensively implicated in the development of dry AMD through its activation by drusen components and other stressors in RPE cells (Campbell & Doyle, 2013; Gao, 2017). By inhibiting caspase-1, VX-765 reduces the production of IL-1β and IL-18, cytokines that are known to amplify local inflammation, disrupt phagocytic receptor expression, impair lysosomal biogenesis, and hence compromise the phagocytic clearance of photoreceptor outer segments—a key process in maintaining retinal homeostasis (Zhang et al., 2021; Wooff et al., 2020).

Expected Effect:
In the context of dry AMD, the hypothesis posits that VX-765, by inhibiting caspase-1, will prevent the maturation and subsequent extracellular release of IL-1β from RPE cells. This is critical as the inflammatory cytokines produced as a result of caspase-1 activation are believed to drive multiple pathological mechanisms in dry AMD, including the downregulation of phagocytic receptors and lysosomal components essential for proper outer segment clearance (Campbell & Doyle, 2013; Lynn, 2018). Recent experimental data in induced pluripotent stem cell–derived RPE models exposed to A2E and drusen extracts indicate that treatment with VX-765 at a concentration of 20 μM resulted in an 85% reduction of IL-1β release, maintained levels of LC3-II (a marker of autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis), and improved phagocytosis of FITC-labeled photoreceptor outer segments by 36% (He et al., 2025; Bhattarai et al., 2021). These effects are expected to translate into a preservation of RPE cell function by limiting inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis and sustaining the cells’ capacity to clear photoreceptor debris. Moreover, rodent studies examining ocular safety and pharmacokinetics have reportedly demonstrated good ocular bioavailability, supporting the viability of local or systemic delivery approaches for treating dry AMD (Schwaid & Spencer, 2020; Wooff et al., 2020).

Overall Evaluation:
The evidence in support of VX-765 as a candidate for dry AMD treatment is compelling scientifically, given the well-established role of inflammasome activation and caspase-1–mediated cytokine maturation in the pathogenesis of retinal pigment epithelial dysfunction (Chen, Rong, & Xia, 2022; Campbell & Doyle, 2013). Strengths of VX-765 include its high potency with an IC₅₀ reportedly around 7 nM for caspase-1 inhibition, its oral bioavailability, and its demonstrated ability to reduce IL-1β release significantly in RPE cell models. The compound’s mechanism—blocking caspase-1 to preserve phagocytic clearance functions and limit pyroptotic cell death—is highly relevant to the current understanding of dry AMD pathogenesis, where impaired degradation of photoreceptor outer segments and chronic low-grade inflammation are central pathological events (Chen et al., 2022; Campbell & Doyle, 2013).

However, there are several weaknesses and challenges to consider. First, while preclinical data in RPE models are promising, there is a lack of direct clinical or comprehensive preclinical studies in ocular disease settings specific to dry AMD. Although rodent safety and pharmacokinetic studies indicate good ocular bioavailability, the translation of systemic caspase-1 inhibition to localized ocular therapy remains to be thoroughly evaluated in terms of delivery route, dosing, and long-term safety (Wooff et al., 2020; Dhani et al., 2021). Additionally, earlier clinical trials of VX-765 in systemic inflammatory diseases have encountered concerns such as liver toxicity upon prolonged administration, although such safety issues may be mitigated through localized ocular delivery or alternative dosing regimens (Dhani et al., 2021; Adamova et al., 2015). There is also the potential risk of off-target effects given that caspase-1, while critical in cytokine maturation, is part of a broader family of related proteases involved in multiple cell death pathways. This could lead to unintended consequences if inhibition is not sufficiently selective (Zhang et al., 2021; Wooff et al., 2020).

Furthermore, the proposed mechanism of action relies substantially on the assumption that IL-1β is the primary driver of RPE dysfunction in dry AMD. Some literature suggests that other inflammatory mediators, such as IL-18, may also play complex roles in retinal physiology, with both protective and deleterious effects (Campbell & Doyle, 2013; Gao, 2017). Hence, complete inhibition of caspase-1 may yield mixed results if it simultaneously suppresses potentially protective cytokine pathways. Nonetheless, the demonstrated ability of VX-765 to maintain LC3-II levels and improve phagocytosis suggests that its net effect could be beneficial in preserving RPE cell homeostasis (He et al., 2025; Bhattarai et al., 2021).

In summary, VX-765 exhibits a promising mechanism of action as a selective caspase-1 inhibitor that could effectively reduce IL-1β maturation, diminish inflammasome-related pyroptotic signaling, and preserve phagocytic functions in RPE cells—all of which are central to the pathophysiology of dry AMD. While the preclinical rationale is strong and initial cell-based studies are encouraging, further work is needed to address safety concerns (particularly given historical issues with systemic administration), to optimize ocular delivery, and to conclusively demonstrate efficacy in relevant animal models of dry AMD before proceeding to clinical trials. The strengths of VX-765 lie in its precise targeting of a key inflammatory enzyme and its supportive preclinical data in RPE cell assays, while the weaknesses include the necessity for more ocular-specific pharmacokinetic data and the potential challenges associated with systemic toxicity that may affect its repurposing for dry AMD treatment (Gao, Cui, To, Cao, & Matsubara, 2018; Piippo, 2019). Overall, VX-765 remains a promising candidate that warrants further investigation with a focus on rigorous ocular preclinical studies and targeted delivery strategies to fully evaluate its therapeutic potential in dry age-related macular degeneration.
