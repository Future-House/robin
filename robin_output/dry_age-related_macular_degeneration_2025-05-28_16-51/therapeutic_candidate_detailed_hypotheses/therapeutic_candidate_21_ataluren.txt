Proposal for Ataluren (PTC124)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Ataluren (PTC124) is a small‐molecule drug developed to induce translational read‐through of premature termination codons (PTCs) caused by nonsense mutations (Michorowska, 2021, pp. 1–2). It was discovered by PTC Therapeutics following high‐throughput chemical screening using luciferase‐based reporters engineered with nonsense mutations, which allowed the identification of compounds capable of overriding translational termination (Peltz et al., 2013, pp. 10–11). Rather than being derived from a natural source, Ataluren is completely synthetic, representing a rationally designed class of translational read‐through–inducing drugs (TRIDs). Unlike aminoglycoside antibiotics such as gentamicin, which were among the first agents to produce read‐through albeit with significant adverse toxicity profiles (Nagel-Wolfrum et al., 2014, pp. 1–2), Ataluren belongs to a chemically distinct, non-aminoglycoside class with a superior toxicity profile and favorable oral bioavailability (Michorowska, 2021, pp. 1–2; Peltz et al., 2013, pp. 7–8). This compound has been broadly conceptualized and synthesized to target the specific pathology of nonsense mutations by enabling ribosomes to “skip” premature stop codons, thereby allowing the synthesis of full-length proteins that are normally truncated in nonsense mutation disorders (Li et al., 2023, pp. 11–12).

Therapeutic History:
Ataluren’s initial therapeutic development focused on genetic diseases driven by nonsense mutations, most notably Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and cystic fibrosis (CF) (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Peltz et al., 2013, pp. 10–11). In DMD, where nonsense mutations account for approximately 10–15% of cases, Ataluren was evaluated in several Phase II and III trials, ultimately achieving conditional approval in parts of Europe for ambulatory patients with nonsense mutation DMD (Michorowska, 2021, pp. 1–2; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021). Although its evaluation in CF clinical trials demonstrated mixed results and ultimately limited clinical efficacy (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2014), these earlier studies have established Ataluren’s safety profile in human populations, with good tolerability over extended dosing regimens (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2008; Peltz et al., 2013, pp. 10–11).
In preclinical and cellular studies, the drug has been tested in various genetic models to restore full-length protein function and has been explored in retinal disease models characterised by nonsense mutations – including conditions such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and choroideremia – where defects in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) function play a pivotal role (Ramsden et al., 2017, pp. 1–2; Torriano et al., 2018, pp. 13–14). Although no clinical trials have yet been dedicated solely to dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the underlying biochemical rationale has led researchers to propose repurposing Ataluren for disorders in which nonsense mutations in genes such as MERTK underlie RPE dysfunction (Li et al., 2023, pp. 25–26). Thus, while Ataluren’s primary clinical history lies in muscular and pulmonary genetic disorders, its mechanism of action and encouraging results in retinal cell models suggest a promising avenue for studies in dry AMD patients harboring MERTK nonsense mutations (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2008; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2010).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, Ataluren functions by modulating the ribosomal machinery so that premature termination codons (PTCs) – which normally trigger the recruitment of the release factors eRF1 and eRF3 leading to rapid translation termination – are instead bypassed via read-through (Peltz et al., 2013, pp. 7–8; Richardson et al., 2017, pp. 8–11). In cells harboring nonsense mutations, this drug facilitates the accommodation of near-cognate aminoacyl transfer RNAs at the site of the premature stop codon, allowing the ribosome to continue translation through to the natural termination codon, and thereby synthesizing a full-length polypeptide with a single amino acid substitution at the mutation site (Michorowska, 2021, pp. 1–2; Peltz et al., 2013, pp. 7–8).
In contrast to aminoglycosides that bind strongly to the ribosomal decoding center and are associated with off-target toxicity due to inadvertent effects on mitochondrial protein synthesis (Nagel-Wolfrum et al., 2014, pp. 6–7), Ataluren appears to selectively influence the translational fidelity at PTCs while sparing normal stop codons (Richardson et al., 2017, pp. 14–17). Its mechanism does not completely inhibit translation termination but extends the temporal window during which near-cognate tRNA incorporation can occur. This selective process is believed to be highly dependent on the specific mRNA sequence context surrounding the PTC (Tutone et al., 2019, pp. 3–5). Notably, Ataluren’s ability to promote read-through is most effective in certain sequence contexts – for example, when the PTC is UGA, followed by cytosine, which is a context known to have higher natural read-through rates (Peltz et al., 2013, pp. 7–8).
Additionally, Ataluren may reduce the efficiency of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a surveillance pathway that usually degrades transcripts harboring PTCs, thereby increasing the pool of mutant transcripts that can be acted on by the ribosome (Wang et al., 2020, pp. 10–11). In retinal cells, especially in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) where MERTK plays a critical role in the phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments, this mechanistic action is of particular interest. MERTK is abundantly expressed in the RPE and is essential for maintaining photoreceptor health through its regulation of phagocytic clearance; nonsense mutations in the MERTK gene disrupt this process (Ramsden et al., 2017, pp. 2–3; Nagel-Wolfrum et al., 2014, pp. 6–7). Therefore, theoretically, by binding to the translational apparatus and facilitating the bypass of the mutated stop codon, Ataluren can restore the synthesis of full-length MerTK protein, thereby reinstating its functional phagocytic capacity in RPE cells (Li et al., 2023, pp. 25–26; Richardson et al., 2017, pp. 17–20).

Expected Effect:
The primary hypothesis behind repurposing Ataluren for dry AMD is that it will enable the read-through of nonsense mutations in the MERTK transcripts within RPE cells. Experimental evidence in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived RPE models from carriers of nonsense MERTK mutations has already shown promising results; in an assay using a concentration of 10 μg/mL Ataluren, restoration of MerTK protein expression reached approximately 65% of wild-type levels, with a concomitant 48% improvement in FITC-labeled photoreceptor outer segment (POS) uptake (Ramsden et al., 2017, pp. 1–2; Michorowska, 2021, pp. 23–24). This suggests that by restoring sufficient levels of functional MerTK protein, Ataluren could rescue the impaired phagocytic function seen in the RPE cells of patients with nonsense MERTK variants.
In practical terms, the expected effect in the proposed assay is twofold. First, there should be a biochemical restoration of full-length MerTK protein as determined by techniques such as Western blot analysis or immunocytochemistry; second, functional assays that assess the phagocytic uptake of fluorescently labeled POS should demonstrate a significant improvement over baseline levels observed in the absence of the drug (Ramsden, 2017, pp. 216–221; Richardson et al., 2017, pp. 17–20). Given that proper phagocytosis by RPE cells is crucial for maintaining retinal homeostasis and that phagocytic failure is a key contributor to dry AMD pathogenesis, restoring even partial MerTK function may have profound therapeutic benefits. In addition, the established oral safety profile of Ataluren from its use in DMD trials supports its potential to be translated into human studies with acceptable tolerability, making it a viable candidate for repurposing to treat AMD patients with the specific genetic defect in MERTK (Michorowska, 2021, pp. 18–19; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2021).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, Ataluren presents as a promising therapeutic candidate for dry AMD in patients harboring nonsense mutations in the MERTK gene. Its major strength lies in its mechanistic rationale: by promoting ribosomal read-through of PTCs, Ataluren directly addresses the underlying genetic defect that leads to truncated, nonfunctional MerTK protein in RPE cells (Peltz et al., 2013, pp. 7–8; Richardson et al., 2017, pp. 8–11). The ability to restore full-length protein expression and thereby improve a fundamental RPE function—phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments—offers a targeted, personalized therapeutic intervention for a subset of dry AMD patients genetically validated to have MERTK deficits (Li et al., 2023, pp. 25–26; Ramsden et al., 2017, pp. 1–2).

One significant advantage is Ataluren’s favorable safety and tolerability profile observed in extensive clinical trials for DMD and CF. The oral administration route and long-term safety make Ataluren an attractive option compared to other TRIDs, particularly aminoglycosides, which are burdened by toxicity issues including ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Its non-aminoglycoside nature also suggests reduced risk of retinal toxicity, an important consideration when targeting ocular tissues (Nagel-Wolfrum et al., 2014, pp. 1–2; Michorowska, 2021, pp. 1–2).

However, there are weaknesses and challenges to consider. The efficacy of translational read-through is highly dependent on codon context; not all nonsense mutations are equally amenable to read-through, and the sequence surrounding the premature stop codon can influence the efficiency of aminoacyl-tRNA insertion (Tutone et al., 2019, pp. 3–5; Peltz et al., 2013, pp. 7–8). In the case of MERTK, while data from iPSC-RPE models are promising, variability in read-through efficiency may translate into only partial restoration of protein function, which might not be sufficient to completely halt disease progression in dry AMD. Additionally, the ability of Ataluren to cross the blood-retinal barrier remains a concern. Although studies in other ocular disease models have employed topical formulations or systemic dosing with success, additional work will be required to optimize drug delivery specifically to RPE cells in the human retina (Torriano et al., 2018, pp. 13–14; Richardson et al., 2017, pp. 17–20).

Another challenge lies in the interplay with nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Since NMD degrades transcripts that harbor PTCs, the available mRNA pool for read-through may be limited. Some studies have considered combining TRIDs like Ataluren with agents that inhibit NMD (e.g., Amlexanox) to maximize the therapeutic benefit (Wang et al., 2020, pp. 10–11). Such combination strategies might be necessary for dry AMD cases where NMD efficiency is high, though these approaches would add complexity to clinical treatment protocols (Wang et al., 2020, pp. 7–9).

Lastly, although Ataluren has been clinically validated for other indications, there is currently no direct clinical trial data for its use in dry AMD or specifically in patients with MERTK nonsense mutations. Further preclinical studies, ideally in animal models recapitulating MERTK nonsense-associated RPE dysfunction, will be essential to bridge the translational gap and confirm both the efficacy and safety of this repurposed therapeutic in the context of dry AMD (Li et al., 2023, pp. 12–13; Ramsden et al., 2017, pp. 2–3).

In summary, Ataluren’s strengths include its well-characterized mechanism enabling read-through of premature stop codons, an excellent oral safety profile demonstrated in large clinical trials for DMD and CF, and encouraging preliminary data in relevant retinal cell models that show restoration of MerTK expression and phagocytic function (Ramsden et al., 2017, pp. 1–2; Michorowska, 2021, pp. 22–23). Its weaknesses primarily rest in the variability of read-through efficacy due to nucleotide context, potential challenges in ocular drug delivery, and the modulation of NMD which may limit drug substrate availability. Despite these challenges, the overall evaluation supports further investigation of Ataluren as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry AMD in genetically defined subsets of patients with MERTK nonsense mutations, given its molecular rationale and demonstrated translational potential in restoring RPE function (Li et al., 2023, pp. 25–26; Richardson et al., 2017, pp. 17–20).
