Proposal for Eculizumab (Soliris)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Eculizumab (Soliris) is a humanized monoclonal antibody derived from an originally murine anti‐human C5 antibody that has been engineered for high affinity and reduced immunogenicity. It belongs to the therapeutic class of complement inhibitors, specifically designed to target terminal components of the complement cascade. This class of biologics has been developed initially for conditions associated with dysregulated complement activation such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. The synthesis process of eculizumab involves recombinant DNA technology to humanize a monoclonal antibody, ensuring exact specificity and high binding affinity for complement C5 (Kd ~150 pM), which reliably prevents its proteolytic cleavage into C5a and C5b (Boyer, 2011, p. 4). This drug, originally discovered for other complement-mediated diseases, represents a repurposing candidate for dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) based on compelling genetic and histopathological evidence implicating complement cascade activation—particularly the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC)—in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) damage and drusen-mediated phagocytic dysfunction (Armento et al., 2021, pp. 12–14).

Therapeutic History:
Eculizumab has a well-established track record in the systemic treatment of complement-mediated disorders such as PNH and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, conditions in which uncontrolled complement activation leads to cellular lysis and systemic inflammation. Over the years, its safety profile has been extensively characterized in these conditions, making it one of the first successful examples of targeted complement inhibition. In the context of ophthalmology, several clinical investigations have assessed its potential use in dry AMD, particularly for geographic atrophy (GA), which is thought to arise from chronic, dysregulated complement activation at the level of the RPE and choroid. The clinical trial NCT00935883, for instance, evaluated systemic administration of eculizumab in patients with non-exudative AMD with the goal of reducing drusen volume and geographic atrophy progression; while this study confirmed excellent tolerability and safety of the systemic route, it did not demonstrate significant efficacy in altering the natural course of GA progression (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2009; Halawa et al., 2021, pp. 1–2). Although the efficacy results have been disappointing in these systemic studies, the hypothesis remains that localized intravitreal delivery—achieving higher concentrations within the ocular compartment—could enhance target engagement and modulate the local complement cascade more effectively (Bandello et al., 2017, pp. 3–4; Yu & Wykoff, 2021, pp. 9–11).

Mechanism of Action:
The pathological rationale for using eculizumab in dry AMD is grounded in the central role that the complement cascade plays in disease progression. At a molecular level, eculizumab binds with exceptionally high affinity to complement component C5, thereby preventing its enzymatic cleavage into C5a and C5b. This inhibition is crucial because C5b serves as the initiation point for the assembly of the membrane attack complex (MAC), which forms a pore in the target cell membrane leading to cell lysis, while C5a is a potent anaphylatoxin that promotes local inflammation by recruiting inflammatory cells and stimulating cytokine release (Grisanti et al., 2011, pp. 4–5; Kassa et al., 2019, pp. 1–7). Histological studies of AMD patient eyes have repeatedly identified deposits of MAC, as well as other complement activation products, in drusen and around the RPE, correlating with cellular dysfunction and death. In ex vivo human RPE–Bruch’s membrane explant systems, treatment with eculizumab has been shown to reduce C5b-9 (MAC) deposition by up to 90% and is also associated with preservation of integrin αvβ5 expression, which is critical for RPE phagocytic function (Armento et al., 2021, pp. 12–14). This detailed molecular interaction highlights eculizumab’s precision in targeting a key step in the pathogenesis of dry AMD by directly preventing complement-mediated cytotoxicity to RPE cells (Lin et al., 2021, pp. 2–4).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis for using eculizumab in dry AMD is that by blocking terminal complement activation, it will prevent the formation of the MAC on RPE cells, thereby reducing complement-mediated cellular damage, preserving RPE phagocytosis, and ultimately slowing the progression of geographic atrophy. In the proposed assays, particularly those using human RPE cells or RPE-Bruch’s membrane explants, administration of eculizumab is expected to significantly diminish the deposition of the membrane attack complex and reduce the local inflammatory response. Given that RPE cells express integrin αvβ5—a receptor crucial for the internalization of photoreceptor outer segments—the preservation of this receptor through complement inhibition suggests that eculizumab could maintain RPE phagocytic function and sustain photoreceptor survival (Armento et al., 2021, pp. 12–14; Punjabi & Kaiser, 2013, pp. 3–4). Furthermore, genetic studies linking complement gene variants with increased AMD risk support the notion that reducing downstream complement activation, specifically through C5 blockade, should mitigate one of the key drivers of RPE cell degeneration and drusen accumulation (Halawa et al., 2021, pp. 2–4; Lin et al., 2021, pp. 7–9). An important aspect of this expected effect is the route of delivery; while systemic dosing has shown safety, localized (intravitreal) administration may offer the therapeutic concentrations required for robust target engagement in the subretinal space while minimizing systemic side effects (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Yu & Wykoff, 2021, pp. 18–19).

Overall Evaluation:
Eculizumab stands out as a rational candidate for repurposing in the treatment of dry AMD based on its well-characterized mechanism of action and extensive clinical safety profile in other complement-mediated diseases. One of its major strengths is its high-affinity binding to C5, which translates into effective blockade of both the inflammatory mediator C5a and the formation of the membrane attack complex, a pathway strongly implicated in RPE cell injury and dysregulated phagocytosis in AMD (Boyer, 2011, p. 4; Grisanti et al., 2011, pp. 4–5). The precision of this targeting is supported by biochemical and ex vivo experiments where eculizumab reduced C5b-9 deposition significantly and maintained key RPE functional markers (Armento et al., 2021, pp. 12–14). However, the clinical history of eculizumab in AMD has been marked by limited efficacy when administered systemically, presumably due to suboptimal ocular penetration through the blood-retinal barrier (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2009; Halawa et al., 2021, pp. 1–2; Lin et al., 2021, pp. 2–4). This gap suggests that for eculizumab to be efficacious in dry AMD, a paradigm shift toward localized intravitreal administration is warranted. Such a delivery approach could potentially optimize ocular bioavailability and ensure that sufficient drug concentrations are achieved within the subretinal space, thus addressing the current limitation observed in previous phase 2 trials (Bandello et al., 2017, pp. 3–4; Yu & Wykoff, 2021, pp. 9–11). Additionally, while the mechanistic theory is compelling and supported by strong genetic and histological correlates, there are concerns that even with localized delivery, the complex pathophysiology of dry AMD—which involves multiple overlapping inflammatory and degenerative pathways—may require combination therapy rather than monotherapy to produce a clinical benefit (Wilke & Apte, 2024, pp. 6–7; Lin et al., 2021, pp. 7–9). Overall, eculizumab’s precision in interrupting terminal complement activation represents a critical mechanistic advantage; however, its success in dry AMD will depend heavily on overcoming delivery challenges and adequately targeting the subretinal microenvironment without causing unintended immunological consequences. In summary, while the underlying science strongly supports complement blockade as being beneficial for preserving RPE cell function and reducing GA progression, optimizing the delivery route and possibly combining eculizumab with other therapeutic modalities may be essential to realize its full potential in dry AMD (Nadeem et al., 2023, pp. 7–8; Punjabi & Kaiser, 2013, pp. 3–4).
