Proposal for SkQ1 (Visomitin; Plantex)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
SkQ1, also known as Visomitin or Plantex, is a synthetic mitochondria‐targeted antioxidant developed as 10-(6′-plastoquinonyl) decyltriphenylphosphonium. Its design couples a potent antioxidant moiety derived from plastoquinone with a lipophilic, positively charged triphenylphosphonium (TPP) cation that drives its selective accumulation into the mitochondrial inner membrane. This chemical framework places SkQ1 in the class of mitochondria‐targeted antioxidants (MTAs), a group of compounds engineered expressly to concentrate at the primary site of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. This class of compounds has been widely investigated and applied in animal models of aging and neurodegeneration, and has even been formulated for clinical use; for example, SkQ1 has been approved in Russia as Visomitin eye drops for ocular indications, and its underlying mode of action is predicated on neutralizing ROS directly at their site of origin. The origins of SkQ1 are rooted in research aimed at mitigating mitochondrial oxidative damage—a key factor in age‐related cellular dysfunction—with its discovery emerging from innovative approaches to disrupt the aging program at the subcellular level (Markovets, Fursova, & Kolosova, 2011; Perepechaeva, Grishanova, Rudnitskaya, & Kolosova, 2014).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, SkQ1 has been studied extensively in both preclinical and early clinical settings. Preclinical studies have used senescence‐accelerated animal models such as the OXYS rat, which exhibits retinal pathology that mimics features of dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD). In these models, SkQ1 administration—whether by oral supplementation or as topical eye drops—has demonstrated an ability to prevent or even reverse retinal degenerative changes by restoring angiogenic factor balance (e.g., normalizing VEGF and PEDF expression) and preserving retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) integrity (Markovets, Fursova, & Kolosova, 2011; Muraleva et al., 2014). Clinically, while many of the human studies have focused on ocular surface disorders, SkQ1 has been evaluated in Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials for dry eye syndrome (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2018, 2019). Although there is limited direct clinical trial data in patients with dry AMD to date, the use of SkQ1 in conditions with shared pathomechanisms (i.e., oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction) provides an encouraging foundation for repurposing SkQ1 to manage retinal degenerative diseases. Additionally, the veterinary and experimental evidence that demonstrates improvement in retinal structure and function with SkQ1 treatment supports its potential utility in AMD, an area where current antioxidant strategies have had mixed results (Markovets, Fursova, & Kolosova, 2011; Muraleva et al., 2014).

Mechanism of Action:
SkQ1’s mechanism of action is rooted in its capacity to selectively traverse biological membranes and accumulate specifically in the mitochondrial inner membrane due to the negative membrane potential present within mitochondria. Once inside, SkQ1 acts as a potent scavenger of mitochondrial ROS, thereby neutralizing lipid peroxides and other free radicals produced by mitochondrial electron transport chain activity. The reduction of oxidative stress prevents cascade signaling that typically culminates in mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular degeneration. There is evidence from preclinical studies that SkQ1 not only neutralizes ROS but also influences multiple intracellular signaling pathways – notably by normalizing the expression of angiogenesis modulators such as VEGF and PEDF, and by restoring the levels of protective chaperone proteins like αB-crystallin, which are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis in RPE cells (Markovets et al., 2011; Muraleva et al., 2014). Beyond its antioxidant activity, SkQ1 appears to have indirect effects on cellular clearance mechanisms: by protecting mitochondria from oxidative damage, it helps preserve lysosomal integrity and the cytoskeletal structures required for effective phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) via receptor systems such as MerTK/αvβ5. In addition, by quenching mitochondrial ROS, SkQ1 may diminish the activation of redox-sensitive inflammatory cascades including the NLRP3 inflammasome, a complex known to be triggered by mitochondrial damage and a contributor to chronic inflammation in AMD (Muraleva, Zhdankina, Fursova, & Kolosova, 2024; Kyosseva, 2016). Biochemical studies further indicate that by preventing A2E photooxidation—a process that leads to the accumulation of toxic bisretinoids in the RPE—SkQ1 may impede one of the major drivers of lipofuscin buildup and subsequent lysosomal and cellular dysfunction (Muraleva et al., 2014).

Expected Effect:
In the context of dry age-related macular degeneration, the expected cellular and tissue effects of SkQ1 are multifaceted. The candidate drug is anticipated to localize preferentially to RPE mitochondria, where it will neutralize mitochondrial ROS and lipid peroxides, thereby preventing the oxidative damage that compromises RPE cell viability and function. By quenching mitochondrial ROS, SkQ1 is expected to block the oxidative mechanisms underlying A2E photooxidation; this in turn will help preserve lysosomal integrity—a critical aspect since lysosomal dysfunction is linked to impaired phagocytosis of POS, a process that, when disrupted, contributes to photoreceptor degeneration and disease progression in AMD (Muraleva, Zhdankina, Fursova, & Kolosova, 2024; Markovets et al., 2011). Moreover, by reducing ROS, SkQ1 should indirectly ameliorate the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a central participant in the inflammatory responses associated with AMD pathogenesis. This effect is expected to temper downstream pro-inflammatory cytokine release and contribute to a reduction in chronic retinal inflammation. On a molecular level, the improved mitochondrial dynamics and a more robust autophagic flux that are anticipated as a consequence of SkQ1 treatment would support proper phagocytic clearance of photoreceptor debris. Given the expression of key proteins involved in mitochondrial quality control and autophagy—such as PGC-1α and Nrf2—in RPE cells, SkQ1’s action might enhance these protective pathways, further stabilizing the cellular environment against stress-induced damage (Markovets et al., 2011; Muraleva, Zhdankina, Fursova, & Kolosova, 2024). Collectively, these effects should culminate in preserved retinal structure and function, slowing or halting the progression of dry AMD by maintaining the critical balance between oxidative damage and cellular repair mechanisms.

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, SkQ1 presents as an intriguing and promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of dry age-related macular degeneration based on its unique chemical properties and documented preclinical efficacy in models of oxidative stress-driven retinal degeneration. Among its principal strengths is its chemical specificity: SkQ1’s design allows it to accumulate selectively in mitochondria, the epicenter of ROS production in RPE cells, thereby providing a targeted approach that supersedes the generalized effects of systemic antioxidants. The preclinical data from OXYS rat models demonstrate that SkQ1 effectively mitigates retinal degeneration by modulating key pathogenic factors such as VEGF/PEDF gene expression and by restoring levels of neuroprotective proteins like αB-crystallin (Markovets et al., 2011; Muraleva et al., 2014). Furthermore, clinical trials in ocular surface disorders have established a favorable safety profile for topical SkQ1 formulations, which supports its potential repurposing for AMD despite the current lack of dedicated AMD clinical trials. The compound’s ability to preempt mitochondrial dysfunction, reduce lipid peroxidation, diminish ROS-triggered NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and indirectly enhance autophagic flux and phagocytosis of POS are critical molecular mechanisms that align well with the current understanding of dry AMD pathogenesis (Muraleva, Zhdankina, Fursova, & Kolosova, 2024; Unknown Reference).

However, several challenges remain. Despite promising preclinical findings, direct evidence supporting SkQ1’s efficacy specifically in dry AMD—in human clinical trials or robust retinal models beyond the OXYS rat—is still limited. Moreover, while the mechanistic hypothesis is compelling, detailed studies are warranted to elucidate SkQ1’s effect on specific molecular targets, such as the inhibition of A2E photooxidation and the precise modulation of NLRP3 inflammasome activity in RPE cells. Optimal dosing regimens, treatment duration, and potential long-term toxicities also require further careful investigation. Furthermore, while similar mitochondrial antioxidants have shown benefits in ocular tissues (as evidenced by studies on MitoQ, SS peptides, and other TPP-linked compounds), the comparative advantage of SkQ1 over these compounds in the context of AMD remains to be fully established (Perepechaeva, Grishanova, Rudnitskaya, & Kolosova, 2014; Kim, Kim, Yang, & Kim, 2021). Lastly, repurposing a drug primarily approved for dry eye syndrome for AMD will necessitate extensive translational research to bridge the gap between its current indications and the complex, multifactorial pathology of dry AMD. Nonetheless, the hypothesis that SkQ1 will preserve mitochondrial dynamics, reduce oxidative damage and inflammation, and maintain RPE phagocytic function is well supported by available biochemical and preclinical evidence, indicating that further research—both in advanced cellular models and in dedicated clinical trials—is warranted (ClinicalTrials.gov; Markovets et al., 2011; Muraleva et al., 2014).

In conclusion, SkQ1 offers a targeted, mitochondria-focused therapeutic approach that addresses fundamental aspects of dry AMD pathogenesis. Its strengths lie in its precise mechanism of action at the mitochondrial level, its demonstrated ability to modulate critical oxidative stress and inflammatory pathways, and its established clinical safety in related ocular conditions. Although further research is needed to specifically validate its efficacy in dry AMD—including direct evaluations of its effects on NLRP3 activation, A2E photooxidation, and RPE clearance functions—the current body of evidence supports continued investigation of SkQ1 as a viable repurposed candidate for mitigating the progression of dry AMD (Muraleva, Zhdankina, Fursova, & Kolosova, 2024; Markovets et al., 2011; ClinicalTrials.gov).
