Proposal for Fenofibrate (Tricor; AbbVie)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Fenofibrate (marketed as Tricor by AbbVie) is a synthetic fibric acid derivative originally discovered and developed for its lipid‐modifying properties. It belongs to the class of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) agonists, a group of compounds that modulate gene transcription related to lipid metabolism. Fenofibrate was initially synthesized for the treatment of dyslipidemia and has been used extensively to lower plasma triglyceride levels and increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in patients with metabolic syndrome. The compound has a well‐established safety record in large populations, partly because its primary mechanism—activation of PPARα—leads to broad improvements in lipid metabolism and inflammation. Its chemical structure enables oral administration and, importantly for ocular applications, there is evidence to suggest that fenofibrate can cross the blood–retinal barrier, making it a candidate for repurposing into retinal diseases such as dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (Shen, 2014; Dou & Duerfeldt, 2020).

Therapeutic History:
Fenofibrate has a long history of clinical use as an antihyperlipidemic agent and has been extensively studied for its cardiovascular benefits in patients with dyslipidemia. Its established use in diabetic patients has also led to significant observations in diabetic retinopathy, where clinical trials such as FIELD and ACCORD have demonstrated that fenofibrate can slow the progression of retinal vascular damage and reduce the need for laser therapy (Karti & Saatci, 2024; Tomita et al., 2020). Although fenofibrate has not been explicitly approved for the treatment of dry AMD, several preclinical studies and mechanistic investigations have suggested that its actions in the retina—specifically its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and lipid-modulating effects—may be beneficial in conditions characterized by retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) degeneration. Additionally, a search of clinical trials on fenofibrate in context with AMD or RPE pathology indicates emerging interest, albeit with only limited direct trial data available so far (ClinicalTrials.gov). This existing body of literature in diabetic retinopathy and neovascular retinal diseases establishes a strong precedent for considering fenofibrate as a repurposed candidate in dry AMD given the overlapping pathophysiological mechanisms, such as oxidative stress and lipid dysregulation (Shen, 2014; Dou & Duerfeldt, 2020).

Mechanism of Action:
Fenofibrate’s primary mechanism of action is via activation of PPARα, a nuclear receptor that forms heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXR) and binds to specific peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPREs) in the promoter regions of target genes. Upon activation, PPARα upregulates key genes involved in fatty acid oxidation, including carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α), thereby enhancing mitochondrial β-oxidation and improving mitochondrial respiration (Márquez, 2016; Tomita et al., 2020). This improved mitochondrial function is critical for RPE health, where efficient energy production prevents cellular damage resulting from lipid accumulation and oxidative stress. In addition to its metabolic effects, fenofibrate exerts anti-inflammatory actions by inhibiting nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling, reducing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and ICAM-1, which are implicated in retinal degeneration (Karti & Saatci, 2024; Wang et al., 2023). There is also mechanistic evidence suggesting that fenofibrate may indirectly modulate the expression of MerTK—a receptor critical for the phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) by RPE cells—through cross-talk with liver X receptor alpha (LXRA), another nuclear receptor involved in cholesterol homeostasis and inflammation (Shen, 2014; Dou & Duerfeldt, 2020). This cross-talk could theoretically enhance the phagocytic capacity of the RPE, thereby promoting clearance of POS and reducing the accumulation of toxic lipid deposits that contribute to the dry AMD phenotype.

Expected Effect:
In the context of dry AMD, the hypothesis is that fenofibrate, via PPARα activation, will enhance fatty acid β-oxidation in RPE cells, thereby reducing lipid accumulation and subsequent lipid peroxidation. The expected cascade is that upregulation of metabolic genes such as CPT1 and PGC-1α leads to improved mitochondrial function and a reduction in reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are known to contribute to oxidative stress in the RPE (Márquez, 2016). Furthermore, by potentially modulating LXRA, fenofibrate might upregulate MerTK expression; enhanced MerTK levels would improve the phagocytic activity of the RPE, critical for daily POS clearance. This enhanced clearance is hypothesized to decrease the buildup of drusen and other extracellular deposits that are characteristic of dry AMD, thereby slowing disease progression. In vitro assays using human RPE cell lines (such as ARPE-19) and in vivo models of RPE dysfunction should reveal increased markers of fatty acid oxidation, reduced markers of lipid peroxidation (for example, decreased levels of NOX4 and 3-nitrotyrosine), and improved mitochondrial bioenergetic profiles upon fenofibrate treatment (Wang et al., 2023; Tomita et al., 2020). Additionally, markers of phagocytosis, including MerTK levels, could be assessed to confirm the proposed LXRA-mediated cross-talk effect. These expected effects are supported by previous studies in diabetic retinopathy models, where fenofibrate showed significant reduction in retinal inflammation and improved barrier function in RPE cells, suggesting that similar benefits might be extrapolated to the dry AMD setting (Shen, 2014; Karti & Saatci, 2024).

Overall Evaluation:
Fenofibrate presents several attractive features as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry AMD. One of its principal strengths is its long track record and well-established safety profile in the treatment of dyslipidemia, with extensive clinical data available from large-scale trials such as FIELD and ACCORD that underline its systemic tolerability (Karti & Saatci, 2024; Tomita et al., 2020). Moreover, its ability to cross the blood–retinal barrier advocates for its use in ocular diseases. Mechanistically, fenofibrate’s activation of PPARα leads to well-documented improvements in fatty acid oxidation, mitochondrial function, and a reduction in oxidative stress—all of which are critical factors in the pathogenesis of dry AMD. The drug’s capacity to modulate inflammatory pathways and potentially enhance MerTK expression through LXRA cross-talk adds an additional layer of therapeutic promise by addressing RPE-specific defects, including reduced phagocytic capacity and impaired clearance of POS (Shen, 2014; Dou & Duerfeldt, 2020).

Despite these strengths, there are several weaknesses and challenges that must be considered. First, while fenofibrate’s effects in diabetic retinopathy and neovascular models are well documented, direct clinical evidence supporting its efficacy in the dry AMD space is currently limited. Most available studies have focused on its lipid-lowering and vascular protective roles, and there remains a significant gap in clinical trials specifically targeting dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov). Second, the potency and selectivity of fenofibrate as a PPARα agonist are modest relative to newer, more targeted selective PPARα modulators (SPPARMα), such as pemafibrate, which have demonstrated improved receptor binding and fewer off-target effects (Lee et al., 2023; Tomita et al., 2020). This raises the possibility that fenofibrate may require higher doses or prolonged exposure to achieve the desired efficacy in the RPE, which in an elderly population could raise concerns regarding dose-limiting toxicities, particularly in the context of renal function. Third, the mechanistic underpinnings of fenofibrate’s purported ability to upregulate MerTK via cross-talk with LXRA, while biologically plausible, remain to be fully elucidated at a molecular and biochemical level in the context of dry AMD. The current literature provides indirect support for this hypothesis, but direct experimental validation is needed using RPE-specific assays and in vivo AMD models (Dou & Duerfeldt, 2020; Shen, 2014).

In summary, fenofibrate offers a compelling hypothesis for repurposing in dry AMD based on its established safety profile, robust clinical use in metabolic and retinal vascular diseases, and mechanistic promise in improving lipid metabolism and mitochondrial function in RPE cells. Its potential to enhance phagocytic capacity through upregulation of MerTK, mediated by LXRA cross-talk, represents a novel mechanism that could address the underlying pathophysiology of dry AMD. However, significant work remains to be done in order to translate these preclinical findings into a definitive clinical benefit for dry AMD patients. Rigorous in vitro studies using RPE models, followed by carefully designed in vivo studies and ultimately dedicated clinical trials, will be essential to validate fenofibrate’s efficacy and mechanistic action in dry AMD (Dou & Duerfeldt, 2020; Wang et al., 2023).

Overall, while fenofibrate shows promise as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry AMD, particularly by targeting the key defects in RPE metabolism and phagocytosis, the lack of direct clinical and mechanistic data in dry AMD models is a notable weakness. The strengths of its well-known safety profile and its ability to modulate multiple pathways implicated in AMD pathogenesis make it a candidate worthy of further investigation. Nonetheless, more specific studies are required to confirm its effects on RPE fatty acid oxidation, lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial function, and the precise molecular interactions involving MerTK and LXRA before it can be considered a validated treatment option for dry AMD (Shen, 2014; Márquez, 2016; Tomita et al., 2020).
