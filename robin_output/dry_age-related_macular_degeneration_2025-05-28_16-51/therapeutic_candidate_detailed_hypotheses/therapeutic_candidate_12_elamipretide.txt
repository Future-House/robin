Proposal for Elamipretide (SS-31)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Elamipretide, also known as SS-31 or MTP-131, is a synthetic tetrapeptide originally developed by Stealth BioTherapeutics that is designed to target the inner mitochondrial membrane by binding to cardiolipin, a unique phospholipid critical for maintaining mitochondrial structure and function (Ling & Chao, 2015; Stefaniak et al., 2024). Its chemical structure, characterized by an alternating aromatic–cationic motif and a net positive charge at physiological pH, confers cell-permeability and selective accumulation in mitochondria irrespective of mitochondrial membrane potential (Ling & Chao, 2015; Stefaniak et al., 2024). This compound belongs to the pharmacological class of mitochondria-targeted peptides, a group of agents that have been designed to modulate mitochondrial bioenergetics and protect against oxidative damage by stabilizing mitochondrial membranes, reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and preserving ATP synthesis (Karaa et al., 2018; Ling & Chao, 2015). The design of SS-31 was influenced by the need to address conditions that arise from mitochondrial dysfunction, a common underlying mechanism in many degenerative diseases, including those affecting the eye (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
Elamipretide has been evaluated across a spectrum of preclinical and clinical studies targeting various disease indications where mitochondrial dysfunction plays a pivotal role. Initially, preclinical studies demonstrated that Elamipretide could improve mitochondrial bioenergetics, reduce oxidative damage, and normalize mitochondrial membrane potential in various animal models of aging and mitochondrial disease (Alam et al., 2020; Stefaniak et al., 2024). In particular, studies in aged murine models have shown that administration of SS-31 prevents and even partially reverses age-related declines in photopic (cone-mediated) visual function, highlighting its potential to address visual impairment linked to mitochondrial defects (Alam et al., 2020). Clinically, Elamipretide has been investigated in a range of indications—including primary mitochondrial myopathy, Leber’s Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON), and intermediate age-related macular degeneration (AMD)—to assess safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy. For example, in the clinical trial NCT02693119, a Phase 2 study evaluated a topical ophthalmic formulation of Elamipretide in LHON patients and demonstrated ocular safety and measurable functional benefits that indirectly support its use in retinal conditions (Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc., 2016a). Furthermore, an open-label Phase 1 trial (NCT02848313) evaluated subcutaneous Elamipretide in patients with intermediate AMD and high-risk drusen, indicating that the drug is safely tolerated in an older population with retinal disease, even though the primary goal there was safety rather than robust efficacy (Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc., 2016b). More recently, advanced Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials such as ReCLAIM-2 (NCT03891875) and the ReNEW trial (NCT06373731) have been initiated to formally assess the efficacy and pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous Elamipretide in dry AMD patients with geographic atrophy, which further demonstrates the translational potential of this compound to treat retinal degenerative diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction (Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc., 2019; Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc., 2024). Although direct studies in dry AMD are still in progress, the extensive clinical and preclinical evaluation of Elamipretide in related mitochondrial and retinal conditions provides a strong precedent and rationale for repurposing this therapeutic candidate for dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Karaa et al., 2018).

Mechanism of Action:
The mechanism of action of Elamipretide centers on its selective binding to cardiolipin within the inner mitochondrial membrane (Ling & Chao, 2015; Stefaniak et al., 2024). Cardiolipin is essential for the optimal organization of the electron transport chain (ETC) and the formation of respiratory supercomplexes, both of which are critical for efficient ATP synthesis. By binding to cardiolipin, Elamipretide stabilizes mitochondrial membrane structure, enhances electron flux through the ETC, and reduces electron leakage that normally leads to the generation of harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Stefaniak et al., 2024; Ling & Chao, 2015). This action results in a dual benefit: preserving mitochondrial integrity and function as well as reducing oxidative stress. In addition to these effects, Elamipretide has been shown to prevent the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, thereby inhibiting the initiation of apoptotic cascades that can lead to cell death (Alam et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2019). Biochemically, the peptide’s ability to enhance ATP production is of particular significance in cells such as retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, which require high energy supply to sustain active processes like photoreceptor outer segment (POS) phagocytosis and autophagy–lysosomal degradation (Alam et al., 2020; Ling & Chao, 2015). Mitochondrial stabilization by Elamipretide thereby supports cellular homeostasis through improved energy metabolism and reduced oxidative injury, both of which are crucial for maintaining normal RPE function and, by extension, retinal health. Notably, in preclinical studies using primary human RPE cultures from AMD donors, treatment with 1 μM Elamipretide led to an elevation of ATP levels by approximately 35 % and restored the autophagic clearance of FITC-labeled photoreceptor outer segments by about 30 %, which underscores its direct beneficial effects on mitochondrial and lysosomal function (Alam et al., 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). This multifaceted mechanism—comprising mitochondrial membrane stabilization, ROS reduction, prevention of apoptotic signaling, and energy restoration—forms the biochemical basis for its proposed therapeutic action in dry AMD.

Expected Effect:
Based on the established mechanism of action, the expected effect of Elamipretide in the context of dry age-related macular degeneration is to improve the functional integrity of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells by correcting mitochondrial dysfunction and reducing oxidative stress, which are central to the disease pathology (Alam et al., 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). In dry AMD, mitochondrial dysfunction in RPE cells leads to impaired autophagy–lysosomal clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) and exacerbates the accumulation of toxic deposits such as drusen. By restoring mitochondrial membrane potential and enhancing ATP generation, Elamipretide is expected to normalize lysosomal pH and autophagic flux, thereby enhancing the RPE’s ability to phagocytose and degrade POS effectively (Alam et al., 2020; Ling & Chao, 2015). This restoration of cellular clearance mechanisms is crucial, as accumulation of undegraded material in RPE cells is a hallmark of dry AMD and contributes to the degeneration of both RPE and photoreceptors over time (Rubner et al., 2022; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Furthermore, the anticipated improvement in mitochondrial function manifests as increased cellular energy production and reduced oxidative stress, which can collectively lead to a measurable improvement in visual function. This is supported by studies in aged animal models where treatment with SS-31 improved photopic visual acuity and contrast sensitivity without inducing super-normal function in young animals, suggesting that its effect is restorative rather than stimulatory beyond physiological levels (Alam et al., 2020). In human RPE cells derived from AMD donors, the observed 35 % increase in ATP levels and a 30 % improvement in autophagic clearance indicate that Elamipretide has the potential to directly counteract the mitochondrial and lysosomal deficits seen in dry AMD (Alam et al., 2020). Thus, the expected effect is an improvement in RPE health, stabilization of retinal structure, and slowing of geographic atrophy progression, which collectively may translate into better visual outcomes in patients with dry AMD.

Overall Evaluation:
Elamipretide represents a promising therapeutic candidate for dry age-related macular degeneration by virtue of its targeted mechanism of action against mitochondrial dysfunction—a hallmark of the disease. One of the primary strengths of Elamipretide is its well-characterized mechanism of stabilizing cardiolipin in the inner mitochondrial membrane, thereby preserving mitochondrial function, reducing ROS production, and preventing the initiation of apoptotic pathways (Ling & Chao, 2015; Stefaniak et al., 2024). These mechanisms are directly relevant to the pathogenesis of dry AMD, in which energy deficits and oxidative damage in RPE cells lead to impaired autophagy and eventual cell degeneration (Alam et al., 2020; Rubner et al., 2022). Additionally, the preclinical data derived from primary human RPE cultures and aged murine models demonstrate that Elamipretide can significantly elevate ATP levels and restore proper lysosomal clearance of photoreceptor outer segments, which are crucial for maintaining retinal homeostasis (Alam et al., 2020).

On the clinical side, the safety profile of Elamipretide has been investigated in studies involving LHON (Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc., 2016a), intermediate AMD (Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc., 2016b), and even Friedreich Ataxia-related vision loss (Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, 2022), providing an encouraging foundation regarding its ocular tolerability and potential posterior segment bioactivity. The initiation of Phase 3 trials such as the ReNEW study (Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc., 2024) further underscores the commitment to exploring its efficacy in treating retinal degenerative diseases, including dry AMD.

However, challenges remain. While the mechanistic rationale and preclinical data are strong, direct clinical evidence of efficacy in dry AMD is still emerging. The translational gap between observed biochemical improvements in cellular models and robust clinical endpoints—such as improved visual acuity or slowed geographic atrophy progression—in human patients must be bridged through well-designed, controlled clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additionally, the long-term effects of mitochondrial modulation in the RPE and potential off-target effects in a predominantly elderly population need careful evaluation given the complex pathophysiology of dry AMD.

In summary, Elamipretide exhibits multiple strengths as a repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry AMD: its molecular design offers targeted mitochondrial stabilization, its preclinical studies show clear restorative effects on mitochondrial and lysosomal function, and its favorable safety profile has been established in several clinical trials for related ocular and mitochondrial disorders (Ling & Chao, 2015; Alam et al., 2020; Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc., 2016b; Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc., 2024). These advantages position it as an attractive candidate for addressing an unmet need in dry AMD by enhancing RPE function and potentially slowing disease progression. Nevertheless, further rigorous clinical evaluation specifically in dry AMD populations is required to confirm efficacy, optimize dosing regimens, and fully elucidate long-term safety and functional benefits (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Rubner et al., 2022).

Overall, our evaluation leads us to conclude that Elamipretide holds significant promise for the treatment of dry age-related macular degeneration by directly targeting mitochondrial dysfunction in RPE cells—a critical driver of disease progression. Its mechanism of electrostatically and hydrophobically stabilizing cardiolipin, coupled with its ability to enhance ATP production and normalize autophagic processes, aligns well with the therapeutic needs of dry AMD. The strengths of this candidate reside in its clear mechanistic rationale, supportive preclinical data, and encouraging clinical safety signals from related mitochondrial and retinal trials. However, the primary weakness remains the current lack of direct clinical efficacy data in the dry AMD population, which necessitates further targeted trials to establish its therapeutic benefit in this challenging and progressive disease. Given the converging evidence from both biochemical studies and early-phase clinical trials, Elamipretide is a strong candidate for further development as a disease-modifying therapy in dry AMD, and we recommend that the team continue its evaluation with carefully designed Phase 2/3 studies to definitively assess its clinical impact (Stealth BioTherapeutics Inc., 2024; Alam et al., 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Ling & Chao, 2015).
