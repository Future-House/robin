Proposal for Apocynin

Below is a comprehensive evaluation of apocynin as a potential repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD).

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Apocynin is a small, naturally occurring phenolic compound that was originally isolated from plants such as Jatropha multifida and Picrorhiza kurroa. It belongs to the class of NADPH oxidase inhibitors and functions predominantly as an antioxidant by suppressing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. In its natural form, apocynin is a low molecular weight agent that, upon metabolic activation—often via myeloperoxidase (MPO)—forms a dimer (diapocynin) which is believed to block the assembly of the NADPH oxidase enzyme complex (’t Hart et al., 2014). The compound has been synthesized and commercially made available (for example, Sigma-Aldrich catalog #A2156), and it is widely used in preclinical studies as a tool to reduce oxidative stress mediated via NADPH oxidase activity. Compounds in this class have been historically deployed in experimental settings to study and counteract oxidative stress in various systems, including the nervous system, the vasculature, and the retina (’t Hart et al., 2014).

Therapeutic History:
Historically, apocynin has been used predominantly in preclinical models that involve oxidative stress–related pathologies. For instance, in rodent models of diabetic complications such as diabetic retinopathy and diabetic nephropathy, apocynin has been shown to inhibit NADPH oxidase, resulting in reduced ROS production, attenuation of inflammatory signaling cascades, and improvement of vascular homeostasis (Asaba et al., 2005; Tawfik et al., 2009). In oxygen-induced retinopathy models—a condition that shares mechanistic similarities to the neovascular aspects of retinal disease—apocynin successfully reduced oxidative stress markers, such as lipid peroxidation and superoxide products, and normalized vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression (Al-Shabrawey et al., 2005). Although apocynin has been extensively evaluated in models of ischemic and diabetic retinopathies, its use in dry AMD has not been explored in clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Preclinical investigations in retinal degeneration models—such as those involving light-induced retinal injury in rodents—suggest that apocynin can mitigate photoreceptor loss and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) atrophy (Song et al., 2016). These studies build a rationale for repurposing apocynin in dry AMD given the shared contribution of oxidative stress to RPE dysfunction and photoreceptor degeneration (McCarty, 2017; Ruan et al., 2020).

Mechanism of Action:
At the molecular level, apocynin acts by targeting the NADPH oxidase enzyme complex—a major source of superoxide and subsequent ROS production in various cell types, including retinal cells. NADPH oxidase is composed of several subunits, including membrane-bound components (such as gp91^phox and p22^phox) as well as cytosolic components (p40^phox, p47^phox, and p67^phox). The activation of NADPH oxidase typically requires the translocation and assembly of these subunits at the cell membrane. Apocynin is thought to interfere with this assembly process, thus preventing the formation of the active enzyme complex (’t Hart et al., 2014). By inhibiting NADPH oxidase, apocynin effectively decreases the generation of ROS. In the RPE, this is significant because excessive ROS leads to lipid peroxidation of cellular membranes and damages lysosomal enzymes critical for the phagocytic clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) (McCarty, 2017; Ruan et al., 2020). Oxidative stress has been documented to impair the activity of cathepsin D, a key lysosomal enzyme responsible for degrading POS components, leading to the accumulation of toxic intracellular debris such as lipofuscin. This lysosomal dysfunction contributes to the degenerative changes observed in dry AMD (McCarty, 2017; Song et al., 2016). Additionally, apocynin has been shown in cellular models (e.g., using ARPE-19 cells) to reduce ROS by approximately 62% at a concentration of 100 μM, preserve cathepsin D activity, and improve degradation of FITC-labeled POS by 28% (Ruan et al., 2020; Song et al., 2016). In rodent models of light-induced retinal degeneration, apocynin treatment correlated with a reduction in RPE atrophy and preservation of key phagocytic markers (McCarty, 2017; Ruan et al., 2020). Thus, the molecular interactions center on the prevention of excessive NADPH oxidase activation, reduction in ROS burden, and subsequent protection of the lysosomal machinery responsible for POS clearance.

Expected Effect:
In the context of dry AMD, the expected therapeutic effect of apocynin is to restore the oxidative balance within RPE cells and thereby improve lysosomal function. Specifically, by inhibiting NADPH oxidase, apocynin is hypothesized to reduce the accumulation of ROS that otherwise inactivate lysosomal enzymes such as cathepsin D. Preservation of cathepsin D activity is critical for the degradation and clearance of POS components—a process that is impaired in dry AMD due to the buildup of oxidized lipids and protein aggregates (McCarty, 2017; Ruan et al., 2020). In ARPE-19 cell assays, treatment with apocynin at 100 μM has been reported to lower ROS levels by 62% and improve the degradation of fluorescently labeled POS by 28%, which is indicative of enhanced phagocytic clearance (Appukuttan et al., 2018; Song et al., 2016). Furthermore, in rat models subjected to light-induced retinal injury, apocynin administration resulted in reduced RPE atrophy and maintenance of photoreceptor integrity, suggesting that improved lysosomal function may translate to a delay or attenuation of retinal degeneration (Song et al., 2016; Ruan et al., 2020). The biochemical premise is that by preserving lysosomal enzyme activity and thereby enhancing the degradation of accumulated photoreceptor debris, apocynin could help maintain the physiological clearance mechanisms in the retina that are vital for preventing the formation of drusen and subsequent RPE cell death (McCarty, 2017; Song et al., 2016). Given that NADPH oxidase types such as NOX2 are expressed in RPE cells—and their dysregulation has been implicated in the loss of phagocytic efficiency and the induction of complement-mediated inflammatory cascades—the targeted inhibition by apocynin is expected to work directly at the level of oxidative stress generation. This mechanistic action should theoretically lead to improved retinal pigment epithelial cell homeostasis and photoreceptor survival, which are critical end-points in the treatment of dry AMD.

Overall Evaluation:
The overall evaluation of apocynin as a potential candidate for treating dry AMD is cautiously optimistic based on the mechanistic rationale and supportive preclinical data from related retinal oxidative stress models. One notable strength of this candidate is its clearly defined mechanism of action: by targeting NADPH oxidase, apocynin directly reduces ROS generation—a central pathologic process in dry AMD. The compound’s ability to preserve lysosomal enzyme activity and promote clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (as demonstrated in ARPE-19 cellular assays and rat models) directly addresses key pathological features of dry AMD, namely lysosomal dysfunction and the subsequent accumulation of toxic debris in RPE cells (Ruan et al., 2020; Song et al., 2016). Furthermore, its preclinical efficacy in related models of retinal degeneration and oxidative stress—in diabetic retinopathy, oxygen-induced retinopathy, and light-induced retinal degeneration—strengthens the argument for its repurposing in dry AMD (Tawfik et al., 2009; Al-Shabrawey et al., 2005).

However, there are also weaknesses and gaps in the current body of evidence. Firstly, despite promising preclinical data, there is a notable absence of direct clinical trial evidence or clinical data assessing apocynin’s effects specifically in dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). This lack of human data necessitates cautious interpretation of the preclinical findings. Secondly, while the in vitro and animal model data suggest improvements in lysosomal enzyme activity and POS clearance, the precise quantitative impact on vision-related endpoints and long-term retinal integrity in dry AMD models remains to be fully elucidated (McCarty, 2017; Ruan et al., 2020). Another potential concern is the specificity of apocynin; while it is widely used as an NADPH oxidase inhibitor, some studies have raised questions about its specific mode of action and whether its beneficial effects might also be attributed to nonspecific antioxidant effects (Song et al., 2016). This ambiguity could complicate efforts to optimize dosing and target engagement in the context of dry AMD. Additionally, concerns regarding bioavailability, tissue penetration in the retina, and potential off-target effects that may arise from systemic administration should also be addressed in subsequent preclinical studies (’t Hart et al., 2014).

In summary, apocynin presents a mechanistically sound and promising candidate for dry AMD based on its ability to inhibit NADPH oxidase, reduce ROS generation, preserve lysosomal enzyme activity in RPE cells, and thus improve the clearance of photoreceptor outer segments—a crucial process compromised in the progression of dry AMD (Ruan et al., 2020; Song et al., 2016). The strengths of this therapeutic candidate lie in its clear molecular target, supportive preclinical evidence, and capacity to counteract key pathological features of dry AMD (Ruan et al., 2020; Song et al., 2016). However, weaknesses include the current lack of direct clinical data, unresolved questions regarding specificity and mechanism nuances, and potential issues related to drug delivery to the retina. Further targeted preclinical studies focusing on dry AMD models and subsequent clinical evaluations would be necessary to confirm apocynin’s efficacy and safety profile in the setting of AMD. Overall, the compound remains a viable candidate for repurposing, warranting additional investigation given the critical unmet need in dry AMD therapeutics (McCarty, 2017; Marchesi et al., 2024; Ruan et al., 2020).
