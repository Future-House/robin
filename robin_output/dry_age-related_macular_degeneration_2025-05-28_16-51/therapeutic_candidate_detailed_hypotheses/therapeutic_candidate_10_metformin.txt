Proposal for Metformin hydrochloride

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Metformin hydrochloride is a well‐known synthetic biguanide compound that originated from the natural guanidine derivatives found in Galega officinalis (French lilac) and was first synthesized in the 1920s, ultimately developed into a widely used therapeutic agent for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (Markowicz-Piasecka et al., 2017). As a member of the biguanide class, metformin is characterized by its capacity to lower blood glucose through multiple mechanisms including inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis, increased peripheral glucose uptake in muscle tissues, and reduced intestinal absorption of glucose (Markowicz-Piasecka et al., 2017). Historically, the chemical synthesis and discovery of metformin laid the foundation for a broad spectrum of applications, and the drug has since been repurposed in various investigative settings due to its pleiotropic properties. In the context of repurposing for dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD), metformin’s belonging to this therapeutic class is of particular interest because the underlying mechanisms—especially those involving cellular energy regulation via the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)—are fundamental to maintaining the homeostasis and function of complex tissues such as the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) (Markowicz-Piasecka et al., 2017).

Therapeutic History:
Metformin has a long clinical record in the management of type 2 diabetes, with extensive human safety data spanning several decades and about 120 million users worldwide (Markowicz-Piasecka et al., 2017). Its primary indication—as an antihyperglycemic agent—has been supported by both biochemical and clinical studies that document its ability to restore insulin sensitivity and decrease blood glucose levels by inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis (Markowicz-Piasecka et al., 2017). Beyond its glucose‐modulating effects, metformin has been shown to have additional benefits including improvements in lipid profile and cardiovascular risk reductions. Importantly, several retrospective epidemiological studies have suggested that diabetic patients on metformin exhibit a lower incidence of age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) compared to non‐users (Brown et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2019). Although metformin has not yet been approved for the treatment of dry AMD specifically, there is emerging observational evidence from large insurance claims databases and retrospective cohort studies indicating that metformin use may correlate with reduced odds of developing AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Jiang et al., 2022). A randomized phase II trial (NCT02684578) has been conducted to evaluate metformin’s potential to slow the progression of geographic atrophy in patients with advanced dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016), and additional clinical trials are ongoing (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). These studies, in addition to preclinical investigations in patient-derived iPSC-RPE models, underscore that metformin has been used extensively in diabetes and other metabolic disorders while investigations into its potential applications in ocular degenerative conditions are emerging (Brown et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2019).

Mechanism of Action:
Metformin’s mechanism of action is multifaceted and has been studied extensively, particularly in the realm of energy metabolism. Its primary mode of action involves the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a central energy sensor that helps maintain cellular energy balance during metabolic stress (Hsu et al., 2021). When metformin is administered, it inhibits mitochondrial complex I in the electron transport chain, resulting in a reduction of ATP production and a subsequent increase in the AMP:ATP ratio. This altered cellular energy state stimulates AMPK, which then phosphorylates a range of downstream targets (Hsu et al., 2021; Markowicz-Piasecka et al., 2017). Activation of AMPK by metformin results in the inhibition of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a major regulator of cell growth and protein synthesis, thereby promoting cellular autophagy—a critical process that clears damaged proteins and organelles (Hsu et al., 2021; Markowicz-Piasecka et al., 2017). Autophagy plays a vital role in RPE cell homeostasis as part of their processing of photoreceptor outer segment debris. Enhanced autophagic flux, as observed when metformin is used, could help restore lysosomal degradation capacity in RPE cells, facilitate the clearance of lipofuscin and A2E by-products, and thereby mitigate one of the central pathophysiological features of dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Romdhoniyyah et al., 2021).
At the molecular level, upon activation, AMPK phosphorylates ULK1 (unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1) and other autophagy-related proteins, initiating the formation of autophagosomes. Concomitantly, metformin reduces oxidative stress via upregulation of antioxidant pathways (e.g., the AMPK-FOXO3 axis) that further support effective cell maintenance and reduction of age-related cellular damage (Hsu et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2023). Importantly, the RPE expresses significant levels of AMPK and other components of these metabolic and autophagic pathways, making them a viable target for metformin’s actions (Jiang et al., 2022; Romdhoniyyah et al., 2021). Therefore, metformin’s capacity to inhibit mTOR signaling as a consequence of AMPK activation points to a mechanistic rationale wherein increased autophagic flux restores RPE clearance function, potentially slowing or reversing the accumulation of cytotoxic debris characteristic of dry AMD pathology.

Expected Effect:
In the proposed assay, where patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) RPE lines are used to model AMD, metformin is expected to increase AMPK phosphorylation in RPE cells. This biochemical activation should lead to consequential mTOR inhibition. The downstream effect of this inhibition is an enhancement of the autophagic process, as evidenced by increased LC3 (microtubule-associated protein light chain 3) puncta formation – a well-established marker of autophagosome formation (Romdhoniyyah et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2023). In the referenced in vitro assays, metformin at 50 μM has been observed to reduce the accumulation of A2E—a cytotoxic component of lipofuscin—in RPE cells by approximately 35%, while concurrently improving the uptake of FITC-labeled photoreceptor outer segments (FITC-POS) by 28% (Brown et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2022). These functional assays serve as surrogate endpoints for RPE clearance capacity, suggesting that metformin’s activation of AMPK leads to improved autophagic flux and lysosomal degradation, thereby reducing the cellular burden of degenerative lipofuscin and other metabolic waste products. In turn, this restoration of normal RPE cell function is anticipated to have a protective effect on the photoreceptors, as the RPE plays an essential role in recycling and maintaining photoreceptor outer segments (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Eton et al., 2022). Moreover, epidemiological studies provide supporting evidence that patients with diabetes who are treated with metformin show a decreased incidence of AMD, suggesting that these in vitro observations may translate into clinically relevant benefits (Brown et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2019).

Overall Evaluation:
Overall, metformin hydrochloride represents a promising repurposed candidate for the therapeutic intervention of dry AMD, primarily owing to its well-characterized safety profile, extensive clinical use in T2DM, and a string of preclinical observations linking its pharmacological actions to cellular processes that are directly impaired in dry AMD (Hsu et al., 2021; Romdhoniyyah et al., 2021). One of the key strengths of this therapeutic candidate is its mechanism of action centered on the activation of AMPK and subsequent inhibition of mTOR, both of which have been well established in the literature as regulators of autophagy. The resultant enhancement of autophagy under metformin treatment offers a compelling strategy for improving RPE cell function and clearance of photoreceptor outer segment debris, which are central to the pathogenesis of dry AMD (Brown et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2019). Furthermore, metformin’s established clinical safety and long history of human use provide a significant advantage in the repurposing paradigm, as the extensive safety data can expedite the transition to clinical trials specific for dry AMD, reducing the uncertainties often associated with novel chemical entities (Markowicz-Piasecka et al., 2017; Romdhoniyyah et al., 2021).
In terms of potential weaknesses, despite supportive epidemiological data, direct clinical trial evidence for metformin’s efficacy specifically in dry AMD remains limited. While phase II studies such as NCT02684578 have been undertaken, results have yet to be published conclusively demonstrating slowed progression of geographic atrophy or improved RPE function in patients with AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2016; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additionally, observational studies have sometimes yielded mixed results with noted heterogeneity in dose-response relationships; for example, some population-based studies have indicated that low-to-moderate dosing of metformin appears protective while higher doses may show conflicting associations (Huang et al., 2023; Eton et al., 2022). This complexity in dosing underscores the need for rigorous dose-ranging studies in the context of retinal delivery and pharmacodynamics specific to ocular tissues. Another consideration is the pharmacokinetic profile of metformin; although rodent ocular pharmacokinetics confirm that metformin can achieve measurable levels at the posterior segment after oral dosing, the extent to which these levels replicate the concentrations used in in vitro studies (e.g., the 50 μM used to demonstrate increased LC3 puncta formation) is uncertain and will require careful correlation (Huang et al., 2023; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). These concerns can be addressed by conducting detailed ocular pharmacokinetic studies and optimizing oral dosing regimens or considering alternative delivery mechanisms that might improve posterior segment exposure without compromising systemic safety.
Mechanistically, the strong evidence supporting AMPK activation as a beneficial pathway for enhancing autophagic flux provides an attractive target in RPE cells, where autophagic impairment is firmly implicated in the pathogenesis of dry AMD (Jiang et al., 2022; Romdhoniyyah et al., 2021). The documented increase in LC3 puncta formation, reduction in A2E accumulation, and improved photoreceptor outer segment uptake provide direct evidence of metformin’s capacity to restore key RPE functions in vitro (Brown et al., 2019). However, translating these cellular effects into clinically meaningful endpoints – such as stabilized visual acuity or slowed progression of geographic atrophy – will be the subject of ongoing and future clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Brown et al., 2019; Hsu et al., 2021).

In closing, the repurposing of metformin hydrochloride for dry AMD is underpinned by a rigorous scientific rationale: its capacity to activate AMPK, inhibit mTOR signaling, and enhance autophagy translates into a mechanistic framework that directly addresses the impaired lysosomal degradation and RPE dysfunction characteristic of dry AMD. The extensive clinical safety profile, combined with epidemiological and preclinical evidence, makes this a compelling candidate for further development. Nonetheless, challenges such as delineating the appropriate dosing strategy for ocular efficacy and validating the mechanistic endpoints in vivo remain. Therefore, we recommend advancing metformin into well-designed, prospective trials with robust biomarkers of RPE function and autophagic activity to definitively establish its therapeutic value in dry AMD (Brown et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2022; Eton et al., 2022).
