Proposal for Carvedilol

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Carvedilol is a synthetic, non‐selective β-adrenergic antagonist originally developed and widely used for cardiovascular indications, particularly in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. It belongs to the beta-blocker class of drugs but stands out because it possesses intrinsic antioxidant properties in addition to its receptor-blocking activity. Carvedilol was discovered during efforts to develop agents that not only lower heart rate and blood pressure but also provide cytoprotection by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cardiovascular tissues (Casini et al., 2014). Its formulation, such as that provided under catalog #C3993 by Sigma-Aldrich, is well characterized chemically. As a repurposing candidate for dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), carvedilol is attractive because its antioxidant capabilities and effects on oxidative stress may be leveraged in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells to alleviate the progressive oxidative damage implicated in dry AMD pathophysiology (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Therapeutic History:
Carvedilol has a robust clinical history in cardiovascular medicine. It is approved by the FDA and has been used extensively to treat patients with hypertension, heart failure, and diabetic cardiovascular complications. Over the past decades, its non-selective β-blockade, along with additional α1-blocking effects, has contributed to its beneficial effects on vascular remodeling and endothelial function. Furthermore, carvedilol’s antioxidant activity has been investigated in various organ systems; for instance, it has been shown to attenuate oxidative stress–mediated damage in myocardial cells by reducing ROS generation and lipid peroxidation (Casini et al., 2014). In preclinical studies, carvedilol has demonstrated neuroprotective benefits in retinal degeneration models such as the zebrafish retinitis pigmentosa (RP) model, wherein its administration improved the visual motor response and preserved rod photoreceptor numbers (Ganzen, 2020). However, although multiple clinical trials have explored carvedilol’s systemic vascular and antioxidant effects, to date there is no definitive published evidence of carvedilol being used directly to treat dry AMD or a retinal degenerative condition in either clinical or veterinary settings. Its potential application in dry AMD remains largely based on its pleiotropic properties and preliminary in vitro observations in RPE cell models (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Mechanism of Action:
Carvedilol operates primarily through its non-selective blockage of β-adrenergic receptors and additional antagonism at α1-adrenergic receptors. This dual blockade helps to decrease sympathetic stimulation in cardiovascular tissues, thereby reducing heart rate and lowering blood pressure. Beyond these classical pharmacological effects, carvedilol has been shown to possess significant antioxidant activity. Its molecular structure allows it to scavenge oxygen radicals, which can mitigate the generation of ROS—a key contributor to oxidative stress–induced cellular damage (Casini et al., 2014; Durak et al., 2020).

Biochemically, carvedilol’s antioxidant function is thought to be linked to its ability to preserve mitochondrial integrity by recognizing and neutralizing free radicals, thereby preventing the cascade of lipid peroxidation and subsequent cellular damage. In retinal cells, particularly in ARPE-19 RPE models, carvedilol has been proposed to activate pathways that reduce oxidative stress. Several studies have indicated that activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2)/antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway—an essential cellular defense mechanism against oxidative damage—plays a critical role in protecting RPE cells from stress-induced apoptosis (Zhang et al., 2022). Although these studies were performed in the context of high glucose–induced stress and diabetic retinopathy rather than dry AMD per se, they provide a mechanistic framework that supports the use of carvedilol to mitigate ROS-mediated damage. Additionally, β-adrenergic receptors are expressed in retinal tissues, including the retinal pigment epithelium, and modulate processes relevant to angiogenesis, inflammation, and cellular survival (Casini et al., 2014). By blunting β-adrenergic signaling, carvedilol might contribute indirectly to restoring lysosomal enzyme activity—critical for the proper phagocytosis and clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) by RPE cells. This restoration of lysosomal function is particularly important in dry AMD, where impaired clearance of POS leads to lipofuscin accumulation and subsequent RPE dysfunction (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Expected Effect:
Based on the preclinical data and the hypothesized mechanism, the expected effect of carvedilol in the proposed dry AMD assay would be multifaceted. In ARPE-19 cells exposed to photo-oxidative stress, carvedilol is anticipated to lower ROS levels significantly—as much as 53% reduction has been observed in similar settings—and to restore lysosomal enzyme activity that is typically impaired by oxidative damage (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). These biochemical improvements should, in turn, enhance the phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments by the RPE by approximately 30%, as improved lysosomal function facilitates more efficient degradation and clearance of POS. Such clearance is crucial for maintaining photoreceptor health and overall retinal homeostasis, and its impairment is a key pathological feature in dry AMD. The mechanism involves carvedilol’s ROS scavenging, preservation of mitochondrial integrity, and potential modulation of β-adrenergic receptor signaling pathways, which may also indirectly influence lysosomal dynamics and phagocytic capacity. Furthermore, pharmacokinetic studies in animal models (such as rabbits) have demonstrated that carvedilol can achieve sufficient ocular tissue penetration following systemic administration, suggesting that therapeutic levels might be attainable in the retina with appropriate dosing (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Given that β-adrenergic receptors are expressed on RPE cells and that Nrf2 expression has been documented in these cells, the action of carvedilol on these pathways is expected to confer cytoprotection against oxidative stress–induced damage (Zhang et al., 2022).

Overall Evaluation:
Carvedilol presents several strengths as a potential repurposed therapeutic candidate for dry AMD. Its extensive clinical use in cardiovascular diseases has resulted in a well-established safety profile and FDA approval, which can greatly accelerate its translation into clinical trials for new indications. Its dual action as a beta-blocker and antioxidant adds an appealing versatility—beyond its classical cardiovascular effects, it can directly address underlying oxidative stress that contributes to RPE dysfunction. Preclinical studies highlight its ability to lower ROS levels, preserve mitochondrial function, and potentially restore lysosomal enzymatic activity, all of which are vital for effective clearance of photoreceptor outer segments, a process impaired in dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Durak et al., 2020). Furthermore, data from zebrafish models of retinal degeneration indicate that carvedilol can preserve photoreceptor integrity through modulation of β-adrenergic signaling, offering proof of concept for retinal protection even though the models studied are not direct analogs of dry AMD (Ganzen, 2020).

However, there are notable weaknesses and areas requiring further investigation. First, although carvedilol has demonstrated antioxidant and neuroprotective effects in other tissues and preclinical models, direct evidence linking these effects to improvements in lysosomal function and phagocytosis specifically in ARPE-19 cells or primary RPE cells remains limited. Much of the published data address its effects in the context of diabetic retinopathy or retinal degeneration models like retinitis pigmentosa, rather than in a dry AMD setting (Zhang et al., 2022; Ganzen, 2020). Second, while pharmacokinetic studies in rabbits suggest that sufficient ocular penetration may be achieved with systemic administration, more detailed studies are needed to confirm that therapeutic levels can be consistently attained in the human retina without systemic toxicity (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Third, the role of β-adrenergic receptor signaling in the RPE is complex; while blockade may reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, it could also potentially adversely affect neuroprotective tachykinin pathways. Careful dose titration and a clear understanding of the downstream signaling effects in retinal cells are necessary before proceeding.

In summary, carvedilol’s potential for treating dry AMD is supported by its established antioxidant properties, possible ability to restore lysosomal function and phagocytosis in RPE cells, and favorable safety profile from cardiovascular use. Its mechanism—encompassing ROS scavenging, Nrf2/ARE pathway activation, and modulation of β-adrenergic receptor signaling—aligns well with the pathophysiology of dry AMD, where oxidative stress and impaired photoreceptor outer segment clearance are key contributors to disease progression (Casini et al., 2014; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Nonetheless, further mechanistic studies in ARPE-19 cells and relevant animal models of dry AMD are required to directly validate its efficacy, as is refined ocular pharmacokinetic profiling in a retinal context. Overall, carvedilol represents a promising repurposing candidate for dry AMD that merits additional preclinical investigation to clarify its potential benefits in this indication, while the existing clinical safety data provide an encouraging foundation (Ganzen, 2020; Casini et al., 2014).
