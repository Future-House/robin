Proposal for Rapamycin (Sirolimus; Pfizer)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Rapamycin, also known as Sirolimus, is a naturally occurring macrolide that was originally isolated from the bacterium Streptomyces hygroscopicus and is now produced synthetically by pharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). It belongs to the class of mTOR inhibitors—a subclass of immunosuppressive compounds that have been extensively studied and used in organ transplantation, oncology, and various inflammatory conditions. The compound exerts its function by forming a complex with FKBP12, which in turn binds to and inhibits mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1). This inhibition leads to downstream effects on protein synthesis, cell growth, and importantly, autophagy induction. As a repurposing candidate for dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), rapamycin’s well-established pharmacology, established safety profile in other indications, and mechanistic rationale make it attractive to be evaluated for restoring retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) homeostasis (Mei et al., 2022, pp. 1–3).

Therapeutic History:
Rapamycin’s history in clinical medicine is well documented: it has been used as an immunosuppressant in kidney transplantation and has demonstrated anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic properties in several cancer trials. In the ocular arena, its use has been explored through various routes, including intravitreal injections and subconjunctival administration, in conditions such as diabetic macular edema, uveitis, and even choroidal neovascularization associated with wet AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2006; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2008; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2011). Notably, a terminated Phase 2 trial of intravitreal sirolimus in patients with geographic atrophy provided preliminary clinical evidence targeting dry AMD; however, adverse safety signals and a lack of robust efficacy in that study temper its immediate promise for dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2012; Petrou et al., 2015, p. 9). Additionally, the drug’s favorable biodistribution in ocular tissues has been supported by investigations using nanoparticle formulations, such as synthetic high-density lipoprotein (sHDL) nanoparticles delivering rapamycin, which enhanced its aqueous solubility and improved delivery to RPE cells in preclinical models (Mei et al., 2022, pp. 6–8). Although rapamycin has not yet been approved specifically for dry AMD, these prior biochemical, clinical, and veterinary studies underscore a broad safety profile, while also demonstrating a precedent for ocular application in recycled or repurposed scenarios (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

Mechanism of Action:
The primary mechanism of rapamycin is through inhibition of mTORC1, a nutrient-sensing kinase complex that coordinates a variety of cellular processes including protein synthesis, cellular metabolism, and autophagy. Rapamycin binds FKBP12 and this complex then directly interacts with mTORC1 to inhibit its kinase activity (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). The inhibition of mTORC1 leads to enhanced LC3 lipidation and autophagosome formation as well as a reduction in p62 protein levels, a marker that accumulates when autophagy is impaired (Mei et al., 2022, pp. 3–4). This molecular action reactivates endogenous pathways of autophagic flux in RPE cells, restoring their ability to degrade and recycle damaged proteins and organelles. In the context of dry AMD, where oxidative stress and chronic accumulation of photoreceptor outer segment (POS) debris lead to excessive buildup of lipofuscin within RPE cells, rapamycin-mediated mTOR inhibition could restore lysosomal function and efficient degradation of these byproducts. This could also indirectly support critical receptor-mediated phagocytosis mechanisms—including MerTK and αvβ5 integrin signaling—that are required for the daily phagocytic clearance of shed POS (Mei et al., 2022, pp. 8–9; Wang et al., 2022, pp. 10–11). The literature further indicates that mTOR hyperactivation in AMD is correlated with impaired autophagy, and that rapamycin, by reducing mTOR activity, promotes a cellular milieu favoring enhanced autophagy and improved clearance of extracellular debris (Wang et al., 2022, pp. 16–17).

Expected Effect:
The central hypothesis driving the repurposing of rapamycin for dry AMD is that inhibition of mTOR in RPE cells will upregulate autophagic machinery, accelerate lysosomal degradation of photoreceptor outer segments, decrease the pathological accumulation of lipofuscin, and hence, preserve MerTK/αvβ5 receptor signaling essential for daily phagocytosis (Mei et al., 2022, pp. 13–14). RPE cells, such as those in the ARPE-19 cell model, express both MerTK and αvβ5 integrin receptors, which are critical for recognition and clearance of POS debris. Enhanced autophagy through mTOR inhibition by rapamycin is expected to increase LC3-II/LC3-I ratio and clear p62, thereby facilitating proper lysosomal degradation pathways, reducing cellular stress, and ultimately protecting against cell dysfunction and death (Mei et al., 2022, pp. 4–6; Niu et al., 2021, pp. 1–2). Moreover, intravitreal delivery studies have demonstrated that rapamycin, when formulated with carriers such as sHDL nanoparticles, maintains sustained ocular levels without significant toxicity, supporting its potential dosage and administration regimen to achieve the desired biological effects (Mei et al., 2022, pp. 6–8; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). These expected effects are underpinned by evidence showing that autophagy induction plays a protective role in various retinal cell types under stress conditions—by promoting clearance of aberrant proteins and cellular debris, rapamycin may help restore critical cellular functions in RPE cells and slow down the progression of dry AMD pathology.

Overall Evaluation:
Rapamycin’s potential as a therapeutic candidate for dry AMD is founded upon its well-established mechanism of mTOR inhibition and autophagy induction, which directly addresses key cellular dysfunctions observed in RPE cells during AMD progression (Wang et al., 2022, pp. 17–19). One major strength of rapamycin is its repurposing advantage; its safety and pharmacokinetic profiles are already thoroughly characterized from its use in transplantation and oncology, and preclinical studies have demonstrated promising results in modulating autophagic processes, reducing oxidative stress, and enhancing cellular clearance mechanisms (Mei et al., 2022, pp. 1–3; Niu et al., 2021, p. 11). In vitro studies using ARPE-19 cells show rapamycin enhances LC3 lipidation and autophagosome formation, which are essential for clearing lipofuscin and dysfunctional organelles, a hallmark of dry AMD pathology (Mei et al., 2022, pp. 3–4). Furthermore, evidence from nonhuman primate models indicates that intravitreal administration of rapamycin can achieve sustained ocular levels, supporting feasible local delivery for therapeutic purposes (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.).

However, there are challenges and weaknesses that warrant careful consideration. Clinical trials involving rapamycin for ocular indications, such as those evaluating its use in geographic atrophy related to AMD (Petrou et al., 2015, p. 9), have yielded mixed outcomes with some adverse safety signals, including retinal thinning and a decrease in visual acuity in certain cases. These findings emphasize the delicate balance of mTOR activity in RPE cell homeostasis; while excessive mTOR activation is deleterious, complete inhibition might also interfere with necessary cellular processes such as regeneration and cellular metabolism as suggested by studies in zebrafish models where mTOR activity is essential for RPE regeneration (Lu et al., 2022, pp. 15–17). In addition, while the hypothesis includes preservation of MerTK/αvβ5 receptor signaling, direct evidence linking rapamycin treatment to maintenance or enhancement of these specific phagocytic pathways in RPE cells is limited in the current literature (Mei et al., 2022, pp. 13–14; Wang et al., 2022, pp. 10–11). Consequently, more focused mechanistic studies are needed to clarify how rapamycin affects these receptors in the context of AMD, particularly in in vivo models that recapitulate the slow progressive nature of dry AMD. Another consideration is the need for optimal dosing regimes that can balance the induction of autophagy without causing the detrimental effects that may arise from over-suppression of mTOR, which is also necessary for normal cellular functions. This is particularly critical given that some studies suggest that prolonged or excessive rapamycin treatment might impair cellular regeneration processes (Go et al., 2020, pp. 15–17).

In summary, rapamycin presents a compelling mechanistic rationale for the treatment of dry AMD through mTOR inhibition and autophagy enhancement, addressing key pathological features such as defective lysosomal degradation and lipofuscin accumulation in RPE cells. Its extensive clinical history in other indications, well-characterized pharmacology, and positive preclinical data in ocular models underscore its potential. Nevertheless, the mixed outcomes in early-stage clinical trials for AMD-related conditions, as well as concerns regarding the precise tuning of mTOR inhibition to avoid negative impacts on RPE regeneration and phagocytic function, argue for further detailed preclinical studies. These should include evaluations of MerTK/αvβ5 receptor signaling dynamics, autophagic flux in primary RPE models, and comprehensive in vivo assessments in animal models of dry AMD before advancing to larger clinical trials. The balance between restoring autophagic competency and maintaining necessary cellular survival and regeneration pathways will be critical in determining the therapeutic window of rapamycin for dry AMD (Mei et al., 2022, pp. 8–9; Wang et al., 2022, pp. 16–17).

Overall, rapamycin is a promising repurposed candidate based on its mechanistic specificity in modulating mTOR-dependent pathways that are central to RPE health. Its strengths include its established clinical use, the robust preclinical rationale for blocking mTOR hyperactivation, and the potential to reverse or slow the cellular degeneration underlying dry AMD. However, its weaknesses lie in the complexity of mTOR signaling in retinal tissues, the potential for adverse effects if dosing is not carefully optimized, and the current lack of direct evidence linking rapamycin to the preservation of MerTK/αvβ5 signaling and effective lipofuscin clearance in RPE cells. Further mechanistic studies and carefully designed clinical trials are therefore warranted to fully assess its utility in treating dry AMD (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Mei et al., 2022, pp. 9–11; Wang et al., 2022, pp. 24–25).
