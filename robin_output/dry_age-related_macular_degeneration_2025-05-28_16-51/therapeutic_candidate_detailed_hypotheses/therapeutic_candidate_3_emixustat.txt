Proposal for Emixustat hydrochloride (ACU-4429)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Emixustat hydrochloride (ACU-4429) is a small‐molecule, non‐retinoid compound originally developed by Acucela Inc. that functions as a visual cycle modulator by selectively inhibiting the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)–specific isomerase, RPE65. Its chemical synthesis involves the design of a molecule that mimics the transition state of the RPE65-catalyzed reaction, allowing it to bind with high affinity (IC50 approximately 4.4 nM) to the enzyme’s retinoid binding site via its critical hydroxyl moiety (Unknown Reference, 2022; Jack et al., 2016). Emixustat belongs to the class of visual cycle modulators, a group of therapeutic compounds designed to regulate the flow of retinoids through the visual cycle by targeting enzymes such as RPE65. Historically, compounds within this class have been investigated to address retinal degenerative diseases by modulating toxic byproduct accumulation, with earlier agents, such as retinylamine analogues, demonstrating the potential to reduce bisretinoid formation (Unknown Reference, 2022; Jack et al., 2016). The molecule is available commercially from suppliers such as Sigma (catalog E1047), and its oral bioavailability, along with well‐described pharmacokinetic properties, makes it an attractive candidate for repurposing in diseases where chronic dosing is required, such as dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) (Basha & Nagipogu, 2023; Kubota et al., 2014).

Therapeutic History:
Emixustat has undergone extensive preclinical evaluation and several early‐phase clinical trials in the context of retinal degeneration, particularly targeting dry AMD and its advanced form, geographic atrophy (GA). Preclinical studies in animal models, including Abca4–/– mice that mimic aspects of Stargardt disease and dry AMD, have shown that inhibition of RPE65 with emixustat leads to reduced accumulation of lipofuscin and toxic bisretinoids such as A2E, thereby improving the efficiency of phagolysosomal clearance of photoreceptor outer segments (Unknown Reference, 2022; Pinilla et al., 2022). In early‐phase clinical trials, such as the Phase 1 dose‐ranging study conducted in healthy volunteers, emixustat demonstrated predictable pharmacokinetics, with a rapid absorption profile, a half‐life in the range of approximately 4.6 to 7.9 hours, and dose‐proportional increases in systemic exposure without significant accumulation upon repeated dosing (Kubota et al., 2014). Further clinical evaluation has been undertaken across several trials targeting dry AMD and GA. Notably, the Phase 2 trial referenced by Dugel et al. provided proof‐of‐concept data demonstrating a dose‐dependent, reversible suppression of rod photoreceptor function (as measured by electroretinography, ERG), which is reflective of the intended pharmacodynamic effect of visual cycle inhibition (Dugel et al., 2015). However, it is equally important to recognize that subsequent larger Phase 2/3 randomized controlled trials, such as the SEATTLE study (NCT01802866) failed to demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in the growth rate of GA lesions, despite the mechanistic rationale supporting the inhibition of toxic bisretinoid accumulation (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Yeong et al., 2020). In addition, emixustat has been studied in other related retinal pathologies such as Stargardt disease, where some insights regarding its pharmacodynamics and safety profile have been confirmed, although the ultimate clinical benefit remains under intense investigation (NCT03772665; Fabre, 2021). Collectively, the historical data suggest that while the biochemical and preclinical foundations are robust, the translation of such effects into clinically meaningful outcomes in dry AMD has proven challenging (Hussain et al., 2018; Dugel et al., 2015).

Mechanism of Action:
Emixustat hydrochloride acts by directly inhibiting the isomerase enzyme RPE65, which is expressed exclusively in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and is essential for the regeneration of 11-cis-retinal from all-trans-retinyl esters. The RPE65 enzyme catalyzes a crucial rate‐limiting step in the visual cycle: the isomerization reaction that converts all-trans-retinyl ester to 11-cis-retinol, the precursor of the visual chromophore 11-cis-retinal necessary for phototransduction (Jack et al., 2016; Kubota et al., 2020). By reversibly inhibiting RPE65, emixustat slows the regeneration of 11-cis-retinal and limits the continuous recycling of retinoids. This deceleration has the downstream effect of reducing the availability of all-trans-retinal, which, under high metabolic demand, can condense to form toxic bisretinoid compounds such as A2E. A2E is known to accumulate as lipofuscin within the lysosomal compartments of RPE cells, interfering with normal lysosomal hydrolase function and compromising the phagocytosis of shed photoreceptor outer segments (Hussain et al., 2018; Unknown Reference, 2021). Cervically, structural studies have provided insight into how emixustat’s hydroxyl group binds the retinoid binding pocket of RPE65, mimicking the transition state of the enzyme reaction and resulting in potent competitive inhibition (Unknown Reference, 2022; Jack et al., 2016). In vitro and in vivo experimental systems have demonstrated that such inhibition is dose‐dependent, with higher doses resulting in greater suppression of visual cycle activity as observed in rod ERG b‐wave amplitude reductions, which are reversible upon cessation of treatment (Dugel et al., 2015; Kubota et al., 2014). Importantly, emixustat’s action is selective for the RPE65 enzyme, meaning that other components of the visual cycle may remain functionally intact, potentially mitigating broad‐based suppression of vision, although some clinically observed visual disturbances, such as chromatopsia and delayed dark adaptation, occur as on‐target effects (Jack et al., 2016; Kubota et al., 2020). At the molecular level, this mechanism successfully links the pharmacological inhibition of RPE65 to a reduction in downstream formation of A2E and other cytotoxic bisretinoids—compounds that have been implicated in the interference with lysosomal enzyme activity and consequent RPE dysfunction that underpin the pathobiology of dry AMD (Hussain et al., 2018; Yeong et al., 2020).

Expected Effect:
Based on its mechanism of action, the use of emixustat in the treatment of dry AMD is expected to yield several beneficial effects at both the biochemical and cellular levels. First, by slowing the visual cycle through RPE65 inhibition, emixustat reduces the production of all-trans-retinal, thereby lowering the formation of A2E and subsequent lipofuscin accumulation in RPE lysosomes—a process that is central to the pathogenesis of dry AMD (Unknown Reference, 2022; Hussain et al., 2018). Preclinical experiments in animal models, particularly those deficient in the ABCA4 gene, have shown that treatment with emixustat results in lower lipofuscin fluorescence and enhanced clearance of photoreceptor outer segments by the RPE, thereby diminishing cellular stress and oxidative damage (Bassetto et al., 2023; Dugel et al., 2015). In the proposed assays and models, RPE cells expressing RPE65 would exhibit normalized phagocytic flux, with reduced lysosomal dysfunction resulting from lower levels of toxic bisretinoids. In vivo, this is anticipated to translate into a slower progression of GA lesions, as measured by fundus autofluorescence and color fundus photography, and potentially stabilization or even modest improvement in visual acuity over time (Dugel et al., 2015; Yeong et al., 2020). Furthermore, clinical data from Phase 2 studies in patients with GA have indicated that while emixustat is associated with significant ocular adverse effects related to its mechanism (e.g., delayed dark adaptation and chromatopsia), there have been trends toward a reduction in lesion growth rates, suggesting that RPE cell homeostasis may be partially restored (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Dugel et al., 2015; Yeong et al., 2020). Given that RPE65 is highly expressed in the RPE of aged human retinas, the hypothesis is that emixustat will decrease the formation of A2E and similar compounds, which in turn will restore the efficiency of lysosomal degradation processes, leading to improved outer segment turnover and photoreceptor survival (Wright & Ambati, 2017; Pinilla et al., 2022). Ultimately, the expected benefit is a slowing of the degenerative process characteristic of dry AMD, potentially preserving central vision and delaying the onset of severe visual impairment.

Overall Evaluation:
Emixustat hydrochloride presents a strong mechanistic rationale and is supported by comprehensive preclinical data, making it an attractive candidate for repurposing in the treatment of dry AMD. Its strengths include a clearly defined molecular target—RPE65—and a well‐characterized biochemical pathway linking RPE65 inhibition to reduced formation of toxic retinoid byproducts (A2E) and, consequently, decreased lipofuscin accumulation (Hussain et al., 2018; Jack et al., 2016). The compound’s oral bioavailability and predictable pharmacokinetics, demonstrated in multiple Phase 1 studies, further support its feasibility as a therapeutic agent requiring chronic administration (Kubota et al., 2014; Kubota et al., 2020). Preclinical studies in genetically modified mouse models have provided promising evidence that emixustat can mitigate retinal degeneration by enhancing RPE clearance of photoreceptor debris and reducing oxidative stress (Unknown Reference, 2022; Dugel et al., 2015).

Nonetheless, several concerns have emerged from the clinical investigations. Although Phase 2 trials have indicated favorable safety profiles and reversible pharmacodynamic effects (e.g., dose‐dependent suppression of rod function measured by ERG), larger clinical trials such as the SEATTLE study (NCT01802866) did not meet their primary efficacy endpoints in terms of slowing GA progression or significantly preserving best‐corrected visual acuity (Yeong et al., 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Ocular adverse events, in particular delayed dark adaptation and chromatopsia, have been common and dose‐dependent, potentially limiting the therapeutic window and patient tolerability (Jack et al., 2016; Kubota et al., 2014). These side effects are a consequence of the same mechanistic inhibition that is intended to reduce A2E accumulation, representing a critical trade‐off between efficacy and safety. Furthermore, while the rationale for reducing A2E formation in the RPE is robust from a biochemical standpoint, clinical outcomes have been mixed; the translation of preclinical benefits into noticeable clinical improvement in patients with advanced dry AMD has proven difficult (Yeong et al., 2020; Dugel et al., 2015).

An additional challenge is the potential disconnect between pharmacodynamic markers (such as ERG b‐wave suppression) and long‐term clinical endpoints like GA lesion progression and visual acuity maintenance (Kubota et al., 2020; Rubner et al., 2022). While the modulation of the visual cycle clearly demonstrates target engagement, it remains uncertain whether these effects are sufficient to counteract the multifactorial pathogenesis of dry AMD, which involves oxidative stress, inflammation, and complex genetic contributors (Wright & Ambati, 2017; Yeong et al., 2020).

Overall, emixustat’s primary strengths lie in its targeted mechanism of action and its capacity for oral administration with a pharmacokinetic profile that enables dose optimization. The molecule’s ability to selectively and reversibly inhibit RPE65 underpins a well‐validated biochemical hypothesis aimed at reducing toxic bisretinoid accumulation and enhancing lysosomal function in the RPE (Unknown Reference, 2021; Hussain et al., 2018). On the other hand, weaknesses include the limited demonstration of clinical efficacy in slowing the progression of GA in large‐scale trials and the occurrence of mechanistically unavoidable ocular adverse events that may impact patient quality of life and adherence (Dugel et al., 2015; Yeong et al., 2020). Given these factors, while emixustat continues to be one of the most thoroughly evaluated candidates in the space of visual cycle modulation for dry AMD, its ultimate clinical utility remains unproven. Moving forward, strategies to mitigate adverse ocular effects or combining emixustat with other therapeutic modalities that address additional pathogenic mechanisms (e.g., complement inhibition, neuroprotection) may be necessary to achieve meaningful clinical benefit in patients with dry AMD (Hussain et al., 2018; Guimaraes et al., 2022).

In summary, the comprehensive literature review indicates that emixustat hydrochloride possesses a strong mechanistic rationale for use in dry AMD based on its ability to inhibit the RPE65 enzyme, thereby reducing the generation of toxic derivatives such as A2E and lipofuscin that contribute to RPE dysfunction and photoreceptor loss (Unknown Reference, 2022; Jack et al., 2016). Preclinical studies support its role in decreasing cellular stress and enhancing lysosomal clearance, while early‐phase clinical studies confirm target engagement and acceptable safety profiles with reversible effects on visual function (Kubota et al., 2014; Dugel et al., 2015). However, the translation of these effects into significant clinical efficacy remains uncertain, as evidenced by large‐scale trials that failed to demonstrate a statistically meaningful reduction in geographic atrophy progression (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.; Yeong et al., 2020). In light of these findings, emixustat’s strengths—its known mechanism of action, oral bioavailability, and detailed pharmacokinetic profile—are balanced by weaknesses including dose‐dependent ocular side effects and inconsistent clinical efficacy outcomes. Therefore, while emixustat remains a promising candidate based on its mechanistic underpinnings, its overall potential for the treatment of dry AMD may be limited unless further modifications, combination strategies, or optimal patient selection can be achieved to enhance its therapeutic index (Hussain et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2022).
