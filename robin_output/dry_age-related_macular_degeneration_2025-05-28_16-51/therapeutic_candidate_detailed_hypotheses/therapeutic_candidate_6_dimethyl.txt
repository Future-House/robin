Proposal for Dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate
Dimethyl fumarate (DMF), marketed as Tecfidera®, is a synthetic fumaric acid ester derived from the natural intermediate fumaric acid, which is a key metabolite in the citric acid cycle. The chemical modifications introduced in its synthesis yield an electrophilic compound capable of engaging in Michael addition reactions with thiol groups on proteins. This class of compounds is defined by its α,β-unsaturated carbonyl structure, which imparts reactivity towards nucleophilic amino acid residues—most notably, the cysteine residues on Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) (Cho et al., 2015). Historically, fumaric acid esters including DMF have been used in the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis and relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). Their clinical utility in these indications is largely attributed to their immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. DMF is rapidly converted in vivo to its primary active metabolite, monomethyl fumarate (MMF), which mediates the majority of its biological effects (Manai & Amadio, 2022). The discovery of DMF’s capacity to modulate the immune system while simultaneously reducing oxidative stress laid the groundwork for exploring its potential application in chronic, degenerative conditions. In recent years, evidence has accumulated that suggests these same mechanisms may be therapeutically beneficial in ocular degenerations such as dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), where oxidative damage, inflammation, and autophagic dysfunction play central roles in disease progression (Catanzaro et al., 2020; Manai et al., 2022).

Therapeutic History
DMF has an extensive history of use as an immunomodulatory agent in neuroinflammatory and dermatological diseases. Its approval for treating relapsing–remitting MS is a testament to its long-term tolerability and consistent efficacy in reducing inflammatory damage via activation of antioxidant pathways (Sheremata et al., 2015). Clinical studies in MS have demonstrated that chronic administration of DMF is associated with a manageable safety profile, predominantly characterized by gastrointestinal side effects that are transient and controllable (Larabee, 2019). Although DMF was never specifically approved for dry AMD, its use in MS has generated a wealth of clinical data regarding its pharmacokinetics, metabolism, and overall tolerability that is directly relevant to populations with chronic degenerative disorders. Preclinical work in retinal models further supports its potential utility. Studies conducted on retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells exposed to blue light have shown that DMF effectively reduces oxidative damage through activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway (Catanzaro et al., 2020; Shimizu et al., 2022). Ongoing clinical investigations, such as the study registered under NCT04292080 (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2022) and clinical‐trial database searches (ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.), specifically assess the long-term effects of DMF in patients with geographic atrophy—a late-stage manifestation of dry AMD—providing an important translational bridge between the established clinical use in MS and the retinal disease context (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2022; ClinicalTrials.gov, n.d.). Additional support comes from studies in diabetic retinopathy and retinal ischemia–reperfusion models, which indicate that DMF’s anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects extend to a variety of retinal pathologies that share mechanistic overlaps with dry AMD (Giunta et al., 2023; Larabee, 2019).

Mechanism of Action
The primary mode of action of DMF is its activation of the Nrf2 pathway. Under normal conditions, Nrf2 is bound in the cytoplasm by Keap1, which facilitates its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. DMF acts as an electrophilic agent and, upon conversion to monomethyl fumarate, covalently modifies critical cysteine residues on Keap1. These modifications lead to a conformational change in Keap1 that impairs its ability to target Nrf2 for degradation. Consequently, stabilized Nrf2 translocates to the nucleus where it binds to antioxidant response elements (ARE) in the promoter regions of several cytoprotective genes (Cho et al., 2015; Manai et al., 2022). The genes upregulated by Nrf2 include those encoding key antioxidant enzymes such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1), and superoxide dismutase (SOD1), as well as enzymes involved in glutathione synthesis. The increased expression of these enzymes enhances the cell’s ability to neutralize reactive oxygen species (ROS) and maintain redox homeostasis (Manai et al., 2022; Shimizu et al., 2022).

Beyond its canonical role in redox regulation, Nrf2 activation has been implicated in modulating autophagy, a vital cellular process that degrades damaged proteins and organelles. Nrf2 can upregulate the expression of p62/SQSTM1, a key autophagic adaptor protein that binds ubiquitinated proteins and facilitates their delivery to autophagosomes. In the context of RPE cells—which bear a high metabolic load due to the daily phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments (POS)—the maintenance of autophagic flux and proper lysosomal function is crucial for cell survival. The activation of Nrf2, therefore, contributes dual benefits by both enhancing antioxidant defenses and potentially promoting autophagic clearance mechanisms that are often impaired in dry AMD (Catanzaro et al., 2020; Manai et al., 2022).

In addition to the activation of Nrf2, DMF has been shown to downregulate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). By dampening these inflammatory mediators, DMF further contributes to the resolution of oxidative injury. In retinal models, such as those assessing blue light–induced damage in RPE cells, DMF has been observed to reduce cytokine expression and mitigate cell death (Shimizu et al., 2022; Shu et al., 2022). The combined antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions of DMF are therefore highly suited for addressing the multifactorial pathology of dry AMD, where both oxidative stress and chronic inflammation drive retinal degeneration.

Expected Effect
In the context of dry AMD, the hypothesis is that DMF will activate the Nrf2 pathway in RPE cells, thereby reducing ROS-induced lysosomal dysfunction and restoring autophagic flux. RPE cells in dry AMD exhibit significant oxidative damage, which impairs their ability to clear POS, leads to the accumulation of cellular debris, and promotes inflammation. Preclinical studies in patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)–RPE models have demonstrated that exposure to oxidative stress impairs autophagic function, as evidenced by reduced LC3-II formation and a failure to efficiently clear labeled POS. Treatment with DMF has been observed to restore autophagic flux by increasing LC3-II levels and promoting the clearance of POS by approximately 35% compared to untreated controls (Catanzaro et al., 2020; Cho et al., 2015). This restoration is critical: by enhancing autophagy, DMF not only clears accumulated photoreceptor debris but also reduces the formation of drusen, a hallmark of dry AMD, and creates a cellular environment more conducive to RPE survival.

Furthermore, pharmacokinetic studies in rodent models have demonstrated that following oral administration, DMF or its active metabolite achieves sufficient retinal penetration to modulate the intracellular environments of RPE cells (Manai & Amadio, 2022). Such data suggest that DMF, when dosed appropriately, can reach the therapeutic concentrations necessary to activate the Nrf2 pathway within the retina. Reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to DMF further supports the expected outcome of decreased inflammation, thereby improving the overall health and function of the retinal tissue (Shu et al., 2022).

The expected effects of DMF in assays using patient-derived iPSC-RPE cells include a robust increase in nuclear Nrf2 translocation, upregulation of ARE-driven antioxidant genes, restoration of autophagic markers such as LC3-II, and enhanced clearance of photoreceptor outer segments. Collectively, these molecular and cellular improvements are anticipated to counteract the pathological processes that underlie dry AMD by lowering intracellular ROS levels, preserving lysosomal function, and reducing chronic inflammation. Such improvements should ultimately contribute to the stabilization or even improvement of visual function in patients with dry AMD, where current therapeutic options remain limited (Manai et al., 2022; Catanzaro et al., 2020).

Overall Evaluation
From an expert drug development perspective, DMF represents a highly promising candidate for repurposing in the treatment of dry AMD due to its dual function of activating antioxidant defenses and restoring autophagic function in retinal pigment epithelial cells. One of the major strengths of DMF lies in its well-characterized mechanism of action: by modifying Keap1 and stabilizing Nrf2, DMF upregulates key antioxidant enzymes such as HO-1, NQO1, and SOD1. This not only helps in neutralizing reactive oxygen species in the high-oxygen environment of the retina but also contributes to re-establishing the cellular homeostasis necessary for effective autophagic clearance (Cho et al., 2015; Catanzaro et al., 2020).

The clinical history of DMF in MS and psoriasis provides additional assurance regarding its safety and tolerability. The extensive clinical experience—with observed chronic tolerability and a manageable side-effect profile—supports its feasibility for long-term use in an elderly patient population that typically characterizes those with dry AMD (Sheremata et al., 2015; Larabee, 2019). Moreover, the ongoing clinical trial NCT04292080 (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2022) is designed to evaluate DMF in patients with geographic atrophy, offering the first direct clinical insight into its efficacy in the context of retinal degeneration (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2022).

Preclinical data derived from RPE cell models further bolster DMF’s candidacy. In vitro studies have consistently shown that DMF restores autophagic flux in RPE cells, as indicated by increased LC3-II formation and enhanced clearance of photoreceptor outer segments. Given that impaired autophagy and lysosomal dysfunction are central to the accumulation of toxic protein aggregates and debris in dry AMD, DMF’s ability to improve these cellular processes is particularly compelling (Manai et al., 2022; Cho et al., 2015).

In addition, the anti-inflammatory effects of DMF—through the downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6—provide a further avenue by which this compound may confer protection in the retinal environment. Chronic inflammation is a known driver of RPE degeneration and photoreceptor loss in dry AMD, and by mitigating this inflammatory milieu, DMF can contribute to slowing disease progression (Shu et al., 2022).

Nevertheless, there are weaknesses and challenges that must be addressed before DMF can be definitively validated for dry AMD. While preclinical studies in RPE and retinal models are promising, direct clinical evidence in dry AMD patients is still in its infancy. The outcomes from the ongoing clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2022) will be critical in determining not only the efficacy of DMF in halting AMD progression but also its long-term safety in an elderly and potentially metabolically compromised population.
Another potential challenge involves the question of retinal pharmacokinetics. Although rodent studies indicate that DMF achieves sufficient retinal penetration following oral dosing, species-specific differences in drug distribution and metabolism may impact the translation of these findings to human subjects. Detailed ADME studies in humans, especially in the context of an aging retina with altered blood–retinal barrier permeability, will be essential to ensure that adequate therapeutic levels of DMF can be sustained in the RPE (Manai & Amadio, 2022).

Furthermore, while the mechanistic rationale for improved autophagic flux is supported by increased LC3-II formation and enhanced POS clearance in vitro, the in vivo complexity of autophagy regulation may present unexpected hurdles. The exact molecular interactions between Nrf2 activation and the autophagic machinery in RPE cells under chronic oxidative stress require further elucidation. It will be necessary to determine whether DMF can consistently induce these effects in the human retinal microenvironment and remain effective over prolonged treatment durations (Manai et al., 2022; Shimizu et al., 2022).

Additionally, although DMF’s anti-inflammatory effects are well documented—with reductions in cytokine expression and beneficial modulation of immune cell activity—the long-term consequences of chronic immune modulation in the retina are not fully understood. The retina is an immune-privileged tissue, and interventions that alter local immune responses must be carefully balanced to avoid unforeseen complications such as impaired response to infections or dysregulation of tissue repair mechanisms (Larabee, 2019).

Finally, even if DMF successfully reduces oxidative stress and improves autophagic clearance in vitro, the ultimate goal is to achieve visual preservation and functional improvement in patients with dry AMD. Clinical endpoints in AMD trials, such as changes in visual acuity and retinal morphology assessed by optical coherence tomography (OCT), will be essential to establish whether the molecular benefits observed translate into meaningful clinical outcomes (ClinicalTrials.gov, 2022).

In summary, the repurposing of DMF for dry AMD is supported by a robust body of biomedical, clinical, and biochemical literature. Its dual mechanism—centering on Nrf2 activation to enhance antioxidant defenses and restore autophagic homeostasis—is well aligned with the known pathophysiology of dry AMD, where oxidative stress and impaired clearance of photoreceptor debris contribute to RPE degeneration. The established clinical safety profile of DMF in multiple sclerosis and psoriasis provides a significant advantage in terms of risk management, and preliminary in vitro data in RPE models further reinforce its potential therapeutic effect. Ongoing clinical trials targeting advanced stages of dry AMD (such as geographic atrophy) will be pivotal in confirming its efficacy in the target population. However, additional investigations are needed to fully understand the human retinal pharmacokinetics of DMF, its long-term impacts on autophagy and immune function in the retina, and ultimately whether these molecular benefits will translate into sustained visual improvement for patients.

From a drug development standpoint, DMF represents an attractive candidate for repurposing in dry AMD due to the convergence of its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and potential autophagy-restorative effects. Its mechanism of action—with a focus on modifying Keap1 to stabilize and activate Nrf2—directly targets the oxidative and autophagic disturbances that underlie dry AMD pathology. The positive preclinical findings, in combination with a well-characterized clinical safety record, justify further investment in controlled clinical studies. If these studies confirm its efficacy and safety in the setting of dry AMD, DMF could fill a critical unmet need in a patient population for which there are currently limited treatment options. Overall, despite some translational challenges and the need for additional mechanistic clarity, DMF holds considerable promise as a repurposed therapeutic for dry AMD, meriting continued research and development efforts (Catanzaro et al., 2020; Manai et al., 2022; Giunta et al., 2023; Shimizu et al., 2022).
