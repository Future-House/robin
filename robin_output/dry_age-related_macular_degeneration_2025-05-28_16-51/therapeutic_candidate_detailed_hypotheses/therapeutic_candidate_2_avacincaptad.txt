Proposal for Avacincaptad pegol (Zimura)

Overview of Therapeutic Candidate:
Avacincaptad pegol (marketed as Zimura, and also known as IZERVAY) is a pegylated RNA aptamer developed through advanced nucleic acid selection methods such as SELEX. It was synthesized using biochemical techniques that yield nuclease‐resistant oligonucleotides with modifications—specifically 2′-fluoropyrimidines—and further enhanced via PEGylation to improve its pharmacokinetic profile and intraocular retention (Drolet et al., 2016; Moreira, 2022). As an aptamer, it belongs to a class of therapeutics that are synthetic ligands, typically having high affinity and specificity for their molecular targets. This drug class has been utilized previously in different therapeutic settings; for instance, Macugen was the first approved aptamer for ocular use, targeting VEGF, which paved the way for aptamers in retinal indications (Bege et al., 2025). Avacincaptad pegol represents a natural evolution of this concept but is specifically engineered to bind and inhibit complement component 5 (C5), a critical protein in the terminal complement cascade implicated in inflammatory processes and cell lysis in retinal tissue.

Therapeutic History:
The therapeutic candidate stands on a robust foundation of preclinical and clinical research in complement modulation for retinal diseases. Early biochemical and preclinical studies identified dysregulation in the complement cascade as key to the pathogenesis of dry age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) and geographic atrophy (GA) (Armento et al., 2021; Nebbioso et al., 2019). Prior clinical trials, including Phase 2/3 studies such as those registered under NCT02686658 and NCT04435366, have evaluated Zimura in patients with GA secondary to dry AMD. In these studies, avacincaptad pegol was administered via intravitreal injection—with dosing schedules typically monthly—demonstrating statistically significant reductions in GA lesion growth and a favorable safety and tolerability profile (Khanani et al., 2023; Guimarães et al., 2022). Complement inhibition as a strategy in AMD has also been explored using agents targeting upstream components such as C3; however, Zimura’s focus on C5 provides a more specific blockade of the terminal inflammatory pathways, building on earlier experiences with monoclonal antibodies like eculizumab in systemic diseases, albeit with the need for localized ocular delivery to circumvent systemic adverse effects (Qin et al., 2021; Patel et al., 2022). Consequently, its clinical development history reflects both the promise and the challenges of introducing complement modulators into the AMD treatment arena.

Mechanism of Action:
Avacincaptad pegol exerts its pharmacological effect by specifically binding to complement component C5 with high affinity (with a dissociation constant in the picomolar range), thereby preventing its proteolytic cleavage into the pro‐inflammatory fragments C5a and C5b (Drolet et al., 2016; Qin et al., 2021). In the context of dry AMD, the cleavage of C5 leads to formation of C5a—a potent chemotactic and inflammatory mediator—and C5b, which participates in assembling the membrane attack complex (MAC). The MAC is responsible for pore formation and lysis of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells and other retinal structures, thereby contributing to tissue injury and degeneration (Armento et al., 2021). By inhibiting C5 activation, avacincaptad pegol effectively halts the cascade downstream of C5, reducing the accumulation of inflammatory mediators and preventing MAC formation (Guimarães et al., 2022; Patel et al., 2022). It is this precise molecular interaction—a blockade of the terminal complement pathway—that is hypothesized to attenuate local inflammation at the subretinal interface and support the phagocytic function of RPE cells in clearing photoreceptor outer segments (Moreira, 2022).

Expected Effect:
Based on its molecular mechanism, avacincaptad pegol is expected to result in preservation of the retinal pigment epithelium and reduce the rate of geographic atrophy progression in patients with dry AMD. Specifically, by preventing the cleavage of C5 and subsequent MAC formation, the drug aims to mitigate complement-mediated cytotoxicity and inflammation. This should lead to decreased RPE cell death and a reduction in the accumulation of degenerative lesions in the retina (Khanani et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2024). Moreover, preclinical models using C5-deficient mice have demonstrated maintained RPE morphology and consistent phagocytic receptor expression on RPE cells, suggesting that inhibiting C5 activity can preserve the critical function of photoreceptor outer segment clearance by RPE (Armento et al., 2021; Nebbioso et al., 2019). The high in vivo stability conferred by PEGylation allows for sustained intraocular concentrations, thereby ensuring prolonged target engagement and therapeutic effect. Thus, in the clinical setting, it is anticipated that patients treated with avacincaptad pegol will show a statistically significant slowing in the enlargement of GA lesions—a surrogate marker for disease progression—even if improvements in best-corrected visual acuity are modest or delayed (Khanani et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2024).

Overall Evaluation:
Avacincaptad pegol represents a promising targeted complement modulator for the treatment of dry AMD, particularly in its advanced form manifesting as geographic atrophy. One of its major strengths lies in its mechanism of action; by specifically binding to and inhibiting C5, it addresses a crucial pathological axis implicated in AMD progression without completely disrupting the overall complement cascade (Patel et al., 2022; Qin et al., 2021). The high affinity and pegylated structure of the aptamer also provide extended intraocular retention, thereby potentially reducing the frequency of injections required to maintain therapeutic levels—a definite benefit from both practical and patient compliance standpoints (Moreira, 2022; Bege et al., 2025).

Clinically, data emerging from phase 2/3 trials such as those documented under NCT02686658 and NCT04435366 have demonstrated that avacincaptad pegol slows GA lesion progression, which has been one of the most challenging aspects of dry AMD treatment. The safety and tolerability profiles reported to date are favorable, with manageable rates of adverse events predominantly related to the injection procedure itself rather than the pharmacologic action of the drug (Khanani et al., 2023; Guimarães et al., 2022). Furthermore, the mechanistic rationale is solidly supported by genetic studies that have implicated complement dysregulation in the development and progression of dry AMD, particularly in the terminal pathway involving C5 and its cleavage products (Armento et al., 2021; Patel et al., 2022).

However, some weaknesses and challenges remain. One concern is the potential risk for an increased incidence of macular neovascularization (CNV), which has been noted in some clinical studies. Although the rates are low and manageable, this risk could necessitate additional monitoring or even combination therapy with anti-VEGF agents in certain cases (Khanani et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2024). Additionally, despite its promising effect on anatomical markers such as GA lesion size, the translation of these structural benefits into meaningful improvements in visual function has yet to be definitively demonstrated, a challenge that is common among therapies targeting chronic degenerative diseases where functional recovery lags behind structural preservation (Lai et al., 2024; Sharma, n.d.).

Another consideration is the rate of intravitreal injection required, which, while mitigated somewhat by the drug’s extended intraocular retention, still poses a treatment burden for elderly patients who are most affected by dry AMD. Continued efforts to optimize dosing regimens and investigate sustained-release delivery systems could potentially enhance the practicality and patient acceptance of this therapeutic approach (Fujii et al., 2025; Nebbioso et al., 2019).

Overall, avacincaptad pegol’s targeted inhibition of complement C5 represents a significant advancement in the search for effective disease-modifying treatments for dry AMD. Its development is well grounded in both mechanistic rationale and supportive clinical data, positioning it as one of the most promising candidates in a field that has long suffered from a paucity of effective interventions. With continued clinical evaluation and potential refinement of dosing and delivery, avacincaptad pegol could offer a viable therapeutic option to slow the progression of geographic atrophy, preserve retinal structure, and ultimately maintain visual function in a patient population with limited alternatives (Khanani et al., 2023; Patel et al., 2022; Qin et al., 2024).
